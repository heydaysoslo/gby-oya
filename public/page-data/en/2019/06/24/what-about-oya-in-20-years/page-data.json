For us, this means finding sustainable solutions for waste, food, transportation, energy and the things we buy – from toilet paper to power grids. We want our festival to contribute to a sustainable future – and work towards a festival that is renewable, plantbased and circular.</p>\n<p><strong>This year´s environmental projects:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://oyafestivalen.no/en/posts/reusable-cups-at-oya\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oyafestivalen.no/en/posts/reusable-cups-at-oya&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562240114769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHomJT8Ol6KbeGqCvO4pB8x3tae5w\">Reusable cups for all beverages</a> &#8211; that are also made available for rental for all other event organizers. When our reusable cups have been used to their maximum capasity, they will have replaces 30 million single-use plastic cups!</li>\n<li>We will be the first festival in Norway to have a fossil-free construction site &#8211; with several new electric construction machines and biofuel for the rest</li>\n<li>No more single-use plastics: We´ve cut plastic give-aways, straws and other single-use objects. Rain ponchoes have been replaced by a free rental system for raincoats and rain boots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find the best solutions we measure, survey and report our environmental impact. We engage the entire organization to find ways to be more sustainable. This means a lot of experimenting, and sometimes failing. Therefore we want to be transparent – so that others can learn from our trials and errors. This work has been distinguished with numerous awards in Norway and abroad.</p>\n<p>During the few weeks Øyafestivalen takes place in Tøyenparken, it feels like a small city. With roughly 20 000 inhabitants, offices, roads, toilets, restaurants, police officers, a library, street lights, renovation, nature, culture, bike parking, stores and meeting points. This makes our festival the perfect arena to showcase new technologies, and test new, sustainable solutions. We hope to use Tøyenparken as testing grounds for a new, sustainable future – and our goal is to inspire you as an audience, a fellow event organizer, a partner or as a business owner.</p>\n<p><strong>Some main sustainability efforts at Øya:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The festival has been run on renewable energy since 2009</li>\n<li>All food served here is organic, and almost 40% of the 100 000 portions of food sold is meat-free</li>\n<li>Plastic-free food and drink serving: All food packaging is compostable and all drinking beverages are reusable cups. This means since 2016, we have cut our use of plastic with 60%!</li>\n<li>All waste is handsorted in 15 different fractions and over 60% of the waste is reused for new products</li>\n<li>98% of all audience arrive by walking, biking or using public transportation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions or feedback on our sustainability efforts- please contact our Sustainability Manager <a href=\"mailto:ingrid@oyafestivalen.com\">Ingrid Kleiva Møller</a>: <a href=\"mailto:ingrid@oyafestivalen.com\">ingrid@oyafestivalen.com</a></p>\n","date":"2019-06-24T10:35:00.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"cof","filename":"img-20170808-163705.jpg","filesize":714168,"url":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705.jpg","link":"/en/2019/06/24/what-about-oya-in-20-years/cof-2/","alt":"","author":"11","description":"","caption":"cof","name":"cof-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":24393,"date":"2019-06-24 10:33:45","modified":"2019-07-03 11:38:09","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":3968,"height":2976,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-320x320.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":320,"medium":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-1024x768.jpg","medium_width":1024,"medium_height":768,"medium_large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-1600x1200.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":576,"large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-1920x1440.jpg","large_width":1920,"large_height":1440,"small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-320x240.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":240,"medium_small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-640x480.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":480,"xlarge":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/06/img-20170808-163705-2560x1920.jpg","xlarge_width":2560,"xlarge_height":1920}},"translations":{"nb":{"url":"/2019/06/24/hva-med-oya-om-20-ar/"},"en":{"url":"/en/2019/06/24/what-about-oya-in-20-years/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"418c846e-bd50-5dd0-982c-422ba2905cbe","locale":"en"}}}
