We will also be releasing a vinyl single with the two bands, in collaboration with the prestigious Rough Trade. This split single is the second in a series which started with Lucy Swann and Team Me in connection with their London concerts last year.<br />\nMusic Export Norway and Øya have previously collaborated several times to introduce exciting Norwegian artists to audiences abroad, both in London, Berlin, New York and Austin. After last year&#8217;s Øya nights in London , Team Me were offered several concerts in England and received increased attention from British music industry and media.</p>\n<p><strong>YOUNG DREAMS AND RAZIKA IN LONDON 23RD AND 24TH OF FEBRUARY</strong><br />\nThe first night, Thursday 23rd of February, will be held at intimate The Lexington in collaboration with the music web site RockFeedback. The two Norwegian bands will be showing off in front of invited representatives from British music industry. The night after, Friday the 24th of February, they will be playing at the popular Club NME at renowned club KOKO, with 1500 capacity. On this occasion, the two Norwegian bands will be playing with the Australian band Bleeding Knees Club. The latter are recieving growing attention these days thanks to their short, catchy songs with roots in powerpop, punk and garage rock. The Guardian has compared them with, among others, New York Dolls, The Saints and the White Stripes. Judge for yourself <a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/thebleedingkneesclub. \" target=\"_blank\">www.myspace.com/thebleedingkneesclub </a></p>\n<p>As always, one expects a full house  when there&#8217;s a Club NME on in London.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The vinyl single with Razika and Young Dreams will  be sold exclusively through Rough Trade shops in England and by the bands at concerts. With this, we strongly believe that the Norwegian artists will benefit greatly from their trip across the pond. Just getting a Rough Trade logo on a release is a big deal for these two Norwegian bands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockfeedback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ROCKFEEDBACK</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nme.com/clubnme\" target=\"_blank\">CLUB NME</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>RAZIKA</strong><br />\nRazika have been one of the truly great, young pop-successes during the past year. Their debut album Program 91 was received with applause from critics and record buyers. The four girls have created their own style, based on, among other things, ska, indie and new wave.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.myspace.com/razika\" target=\"_blank\">www.myspace.com/razika</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>YOUNG DREAMS</strong><br />\nThis band is comprised of people from a variety of the west coast&#8217;s finest pop and rock bands. As Young Dreams, they make melodic music inspired by everything from acid rock to symphonic pop. Their debut album is coming in 2012.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youngdreams.no/\" target=\"_blank\">www.youngdreams.no</a></p>\n","date":"2012-01-25T13:14:24.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen øyafestivalen 2013 635x350","filename":"Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","filesize":87108,"url":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","link":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/razika-kristine-jakobsen-oyafestivalen-2013-635x350-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"razika-kristine-jakobsen-oyafestivalen-2013-635x350-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2013-01-16 12:46:48","modified":"2013-01-16 12:46:48","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2013/01/Razika-Kristine-Jakobsen-yafestivalen-2013-635x350.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/01/25/%c3%b8ya-take-razika-and-young-dreams-to-london/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1876f5b4-afc0-5df7-a991-d86211754f65","locale":"en"}}}
