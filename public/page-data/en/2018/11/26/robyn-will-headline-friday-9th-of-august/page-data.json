The new successful album Honey was released in October and went straight to second place in the Norwegian charts. Robyn is a fantastic live artist, an industry-leading pioneer and a great inspiration for many.</p>\n<p>She started her international pop career with songs like Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect) and Show Me Love in the mid 90&#8217;s.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her self-titled album from 2005, showed a more mature musician. With songs like Be Mine, Who&#8217;s That Girl? and With Every Heartbeat she was in the charts all over the world. In 2010 she began a bold project releasing three EPs in a year. The Body Talk collection is packed with hits – and received great acclaim. In 2014, she collaborated with Röyksopp on the mini-album Do It Again. The following year she released an EP together with keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and now deceased producer Christian Falk, using the name La Bagatelle Magique.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now she is back with new songs and a fantastic liveshow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robyn/\">www.facebook.com/robyn</a></p>\n","date":"2018-11-26T07:35:02.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"Robyn_Honey_8 crop","filename":"robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","filesize":94340,"url":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","link":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/robyn_honey_8-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"robyn_honey_8-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2018-11-20 09:40:40","modified":"2018-11-20 09:40:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop-300x188.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":188,"medium_large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop-768x480.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":480,"large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":500,"small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":200,"medium_small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":400,"xlarge":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2018/11/robyn-honey-8-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":500}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2018/11/26/robyn-will-headline-friday-9th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"abc45b87-9620-5f62-872f-7fb853a34f35","locale":"en"}}}
