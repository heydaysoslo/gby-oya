As the sun sets on Tøyen park, the day program gives way to the nocturnal urges and Jaeger springs to life as part of the annual Øyanatt festival. For one week in the year our weekly residencies join the Øya lineup with a star-studded guestlist that have included Jamie xx, Avalon Emerson, Floating Points, Bjarki and Sassy J in recent years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2019 Untzdag, Retro, Frædag and Affirmative Action collaborate with Øya in bringing the festival spirit to the club concept with an eye-watering guestlist of some of the world’s best selectors and electronic music artists to our basement. Øyvind Morken, Daniel Gude, g-HA &amp; Olanskii and Karima F play host to Skatebård, Josey Rebelle, Bufiman, I Hate Models, Cynthie, Prins Thomas and Anetha for this year’s edition of Øyanatt,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prins Thomas does a marathon three hours in our booth on Frædag with g-HA &amp; Olanskii, Olefonken and Cinthie while I hate Models and Anetha bring their individual styles of brooding electronica to our basement for Daniel Gude’s Retro. Øyvind Morken hosts Jan Schültze as Bufiman while Karima F rounds up our Øya festival weekender with her guest of honour at Affirmative Action, Josey Rebelle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>07.08 &#8211; Untzdag: Bufiman (DE) and Øyvind Morken</strong></p>\n<p><strong>cc:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Øya Pass</strong>: 70</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong>: 100</p>\n<p>ID: 20</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bufiman</p>\n<p>Bufiman is the alias of Jan Schulte, a versatile producer, DJ, rhythm enthusiast and a mesmerizing harpist. Never one to placate old and tired tropes, Schülte dabbles in an array of musical styles under aliases like Wolf Müller, Diskoking, Bernhard McCoolski and of course Bufiman. A resident at Salon de Amateurs for the past five years, Schulte has played an integral role in the Düsseldorf club’s descent into the weird and wonderful dance psychedelia which has put the club firmly on the map in recent years. In his enthusiastic percussive sets he gingerly jumps genres decades and styles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>08.08 &#8211; Retro: I Hate Models (FR), Anthea (FR), Skatebård and Daniel Gude</strong></p>\n<p><strong>cc:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Øya Pass</strong>: 150</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong>: 200</p>\n<p>ID: 20</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Skatebård</p>\n<p>Skatebård is a national treasure. The Norwegian producer of all things electronic staked his claim with his debut LP “Skateboarding was a crime in 1989” and never looked back from there..Connoisseurs know that his catalogue oscillates between emotional techno, neo-italo, electro from an alternative future and a Scando-cosmic reinterpretation of pure Detroitian house which he channels into enigmatic and enthusiastic DJ sets that have one him the acclaim from the international Dj community and its audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I Hate Models</p>\n<p>I Hate Models’ accent has been With a variety of releases on labels such as ARTS, Voitax, T/W/B or Pls.uk, he is as eclectic in his productions as in his DJ sets, and navigates between Rave music, Industrial sounds or EBMish productions.He tries to not limit himself to a genre or style, exploring all electronic universes, with an emphasis on emotional synths and colder sounds. With an artistic line based on the expression of melancholia and intense emotions, his music can be characterized by the contrast between love and hate, darkness and light.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anetha</p>\n<p>Inspired by new wave and electronic music, Anetha always oscillates between acid lines, melancholic melodies, hypnotic patterns and strong grooves. She also loves to play 90’s old school tracks, and definitely knows how to set her audience in motion, offering an intense and pulsating journey through her selections. Anetha also co-manages Blocaus Series, the imprint started with her collective in 2016 to develop the French local scene alongside great remixers. In 2015 she released her first EP on “Work Them Records” followed by releases for kindred spirited labels like Anagram. As a DJ, she&#8217;s made a formidable impact having played Concrete, Bassiani, De School and Berghain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>09.08 Frædag: Cinthie (DE), Prins Thomas, g-HA &amp; Olasnkii and Olefonken</strong></p>\n<p><strong>cc:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Øya Pass</strong>: 150</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong>: 200</p>\n<p>ID: 20</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cinthie</p>\n<p>Berlin based DJ and producer, label owner of 803 Crystal Grooves, Beste Modus, Unison Wax, Beste Freunde and we_r house, Fritz Radio Host, Elevate record store owner and proud parent.Cinthie is a multifaceted force on the electronic music landscape with close associations with AUS, and the Beste Modus- and Elevate Berlin collectives. She travels the world with her sets, but it is in Berlin where she’s cut her teeth to become one of the world’s most inspiring selectors. Djing in the German capital since the early nineties as a teenager, Cinthie&#8217;s depth of knowledge radiantly shines through in her sets and her productions, which traverse through a broad range of classic and contemporary House and Techno sounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prins Thomas</p>\n<p>Prins Thomas’ contribution to the Oslo music scene is unmatched, but his beginnings are humble. The Prins had to go through the school of hard knocks like so many before him. Back, way back in time, he started playing around as a DJ at a puerile age. Viewed as an extension of his break-dancing efforts, belt-driven turntables where enough to support his mix of hip hop, electro and an array of Arthur Baker’s and Shep Pettibone’s jewels. But as soon as he picked up the bass and played in more bands than Norway has trees, the joy of the turntable took a back seat. Until the early nineties arrived that is. Prins still didn’t have his reliable gang of co-conspirators, but he picked up a weekly residence, where he championed sounds as far fetched as Miles Davis or The Doors together with the craze that was started by Phuture’s “Acid Tracks”. That passion for the music and the legacy of places like paradise garage has been channeled through every aspect of Prins Thomas’ being. Through his label Full Pupp and through his sets he is musical connoisseur with unparalleled skills in the booth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10.08 Nightflight x Affirmative Action: Josey Rebelle (UK) and Karima F</strong></p>\n<p><strong>cc:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Øya Pass</strong>: 150</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong>: 200</p>\n<p>ID: 23</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Josey Rebelle</p>\n<p>Josey was introduced to the decks at an early age, taught to DJ by her brother on his house, techno and hardcore collection when she was 13, but it was some years later that she graduated from bedroom DJ to the club, eventually earning her stripes as a resident at legendary London basement club Plastic People. She has since graced the line-ups of clubs such as Panorama Bar, Fabric, Concrete, Good Room, De School and Nitsa. Josey has also entertained audiences Dimensions, Primavera Sound, Bestival and Afropunk NYC, has recorded highly-acclaimed mixes for Resident Advisor, The Fader, Discwoman, Fact Magazine and BBC Radio 1, and also appeared on the very first official Boiler Room broadcast in 2010. While her club sets centre around house, techno and breakbeat sounds old and new, Josey demonstrates the full spectrum of her musical knowledge on her three-hour Sunday morning Rinse FM shows, described by Time Out as ‘the best way to spend a Sunday.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OM ØYANATT: Øyanatt er konserter og klubbkonsepter rundt omkring i Oslo sentrum etter at Tøyenparken stenger 23.00. Dette er altså en glimrende mulighet til å ta med seg den gode festivalstemninga inn i byen etterpå. Øyanatt lages i samarbeid med de beste arrangørene og klubbene i Oslo. Grunnet varierende forutsetninger og behovet for at arrangørene skal få disse konsertene/klubbkonseptene til å gå rundt på egenhånd, gjør det ikke mulig å inkludere Øyanatt i festivalpasset. Gyldig Øya-billett til den aktuelle dagen (evt ukespass) gir rabatt på Øyanatt-arrangement.</p>\n","date":"2019-07-04T11:06:14.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"Josey-Rebelle-27 bw","filename":"josey-rebelle-27-bw.jpg","filesize":60128,"url":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw.jpg","link":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/?attachment_id=24374","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"josey-rebelle-27-bw","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":24372,"date":"2019-07-02 09:20:14","modified":"2019-07-02 09:20:14","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":1200,"height":795,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw-320x320.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":320,"medium":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw-1024x678.jpg","medium_width":1024,"medium_height":678,"medium_large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":509,"large":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw.jpg","large_width":1200,"large_height":795,"small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw-320x212.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":212,"medium_small":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw-640x424.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":424,"xlarge":"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/assets/uploads/2019/07/josey-rebelle-27-bw.jpg","xlarge_width":1200,"xlarge_height":795}},"translations":{"nb":{"url":"/2019/07/04/stort-oyanatt-program-pa-jaeger/"},"en":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ddcf8782-acc9-5913-b700-c49448e21db7","locale":"nb"}}}
