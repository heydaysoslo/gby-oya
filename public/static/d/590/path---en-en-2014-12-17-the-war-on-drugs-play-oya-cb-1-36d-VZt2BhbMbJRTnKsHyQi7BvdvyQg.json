{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"The War On Drugs play Øya!","date":"17th December 2014","content":"<p>The War On Drugs released Lost In The Dream in March 2014. The album is number one on countless best-of-2014-lists these days. It was their first to enter the top 30 in the American album charts. In Norway it got as far as number nine. On Wednesday 12<sup>th</sup> of August you can hear these great songs in the beautiful Tøyenparken.</p>\n<p>The band was formed by Adam Granduciel in Philadelphia back in 2005. Originally Kurt Vile was a member, but he moved on to a successful solo career. The War On Drugs mix equal parts American guitar rock with a big sound and melancholic indie pop. They got increasing attention with the two previous albums Wagonwheel Blues (2008) and Slave Ambient (2011). After the latter, they played Øya for the first time. Now they are back to fill your ears with delicious tunes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/review/179731-the-war-on-drugs-lost-in-the-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">As Popmatters.com wrote</a>: &#8211; With their third album, the War on Drugs continue to recreate classic rock in their own image and in doing so they created a classic album of their own.</p>\n<p>Lost In The Dream is in first place on lists of 2014’s best albums in iTunes, Q Magazine, Uncut, Consequence Of Sound and more.</p>\n<p>We think The War On Drugs at Øya can be one of this year&#8217;s big festival gigs. Their songs and sound will be like the most comfortable summer breeze in your ear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thewarondrugs.net/\">www.thewarondrugs.net</a></p>\n<p>photo Dusdin Condren</p>\n","wordpress_id":15670,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2014/12/17/the-war-on-drugs-play-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1458e34b-e048-5204-845f-c5d44a444254","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
