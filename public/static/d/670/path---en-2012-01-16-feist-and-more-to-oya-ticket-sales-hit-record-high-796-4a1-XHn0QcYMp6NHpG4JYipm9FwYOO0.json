The number of week passes sold is already the same as in early April last year. We are now releasing another three exciting names. There will be more artist releases for this summer&#8217;s big music happening in the weeks to come.</p>\n<p>Feist is an artist we&#8217;ve wanted to present at the festival for several years. Her popularity in Norway is bigger than ever and it is now confirmed that she will be playing at The Øya Festival Wednesday the 8th of August. Mirror Lakes is a new band with established musicians, fronted by Knut Schreiner and Frode Fivel. Their debut album is coming soon and in August they&#8217;ll play at Øya. Newcomers Highasakite from Trondheim are also confirmed. Their debut album is just around the corner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FEIST (CA)<br />\nDuring recent years, Leslie Feist has been has been on our wish list for the past festivals. It is with much excitement that we confirm that she is finally coming to Øya. Her international breakthrough came in 2007 with the album The Reminder. This autumn, she followed up with Metals.</p>\n<p>Feist grew up in Calgary and this was where she played in her first band. She first received considerable attention internationally as a member of the indie band Broken Social Scene about ten years ago. Since then, she has collaborated with people like Beck, Grizzly Bear and Wilco. Among her plans for 2012 is to provide a spilt single with Mastodon, where they are to cover each other&#8217;s songs.</p>\n<p>Her strength has always been good, strong and melancholic songs. More and more people have opened their ears to Feist, and her concert at Sentrum Scene in March is sold out long ago. On Wednesday the 8th of August, she is returning to Oslo to play at the Øya festival.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.listentofeist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.listentofeist.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MIRROR LAKES<br />\nA few weeks ago, one could read about a new band constellation in the music magazine ENO. Knut Schreiner (Euroboys, Turbonegro + + +) and Frode Fivel (solo and Hello Goodbye) are the two most prominent people of Mirror Lakes. They first got Trond Mjøen from Euroboys. Later they found Havard Krogedal from I Was a King and Loch Ness Mouse on bass, and Arne Mathisen from Heroes &amp; Zeros and PowPow on drums. The basisfor Mirror Lakes were formed when the two first met at a concert with The Soundtrack Of Our Lives and Dungen in Oslo a few years ago.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, these guys have worked determinedly with Mirror Lakes and will soon release their debut album on Warner. Last year, they worked in the studio with Soundtrack bass player and super-producer Kalle Gustafsson. The album is recorded in Gothenburg, Oslo and New York. The result is melodic rock hinting at of the different members&#8217; previous work. This is how they&#8217;re described in their press release: &#8220;Mirror Lakes is a bit like a singer / songwriter backed by a loud rock band with a distinctive sound and good arrangements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We look forward to presenting this group at a large stage in August and we&#8217;re confident that they&#8217;re a live band many will appreciate in 2012.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HIGHASAKITE<br />\nOne of this winter&#8217;s joyful discoveries at the Øya office has been Highasakite. They impressed us at the intimate venue Mono just before Christmas and now they&#8217;re ready for the festival in August. In the beginning of February, they are releasing their debut album All That Floats Will Rain, which the band themselves call a cool, modern electronic rainbow of an indiepop album. The members have backgrounds from bands like PELbO, Sacred Harp and Your Head Lights Are On. Vocalist Ingrid Helene Håvik has a strong and steady voice, which gives the songs character. Things are happening quickly for this band. If they keep up the pace from the last six months, this Norwegian name will be on everyone&#8217;s lips at the festival in August.</p>\n","date":"2012-01-16T09:48:35.000Z","wordpress_id":1653,"featured_image":{"title":"feist øyafestivalen 2012 635x350","filename":"feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","filesize":159046,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/feist-oyafestivalen-2012-635x350-2-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"feist-oyafestivalen-2012-635x350-2-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2012-01-11 19:00:42","modified":"2012-01-11 19:00:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/01/feist-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/01/16/feist-and-more-to-oya-ticket-sales-hit-record-high/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c596e80e-a163-50da-b516-ac0e794407e9","locale":"en"}}
