Since then they are drawing bigger crowds abroad every year, and will have a special focus on the international market in 2016.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Highasakite &#8211; Friday 12<sup>th</sup> of August</strong></p>\n<p>Highasakite just released the first single from the forthcoming third album, Camp Echo. 2014’s Silent Treatment, went to number one in Norway and made the band one the country’s biggest. The album broke the record by spending 94 weeks in the charts.</p>\n<p>The band’s unique sound is based on dark, dramatic and electronic pop, which sounds vulnerable and big at the same time. Highasakite’s growing interest from abroad will make them spend a lot of 2016 on the road, around the world.</p>\n<p>The Line Of Best Fit about the previous album: &#8211; Silent Treatment animates melodic pop songs and paints a Björk-dipped-in-Cocteau Twins fantasia of iridescent synths, yet one always shunted along by powerful, clashing drums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.highasakite.no/\">http://www.highasakite.no/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.highasakite.no/\">www.highasakite.no</a></p>\n<p>photo: Lasse Fløde</p>\n","date":"2016-02-03T08:36:31.000Z","wordpress_id":5821,"featured_image":{"title":"Highasakite_Lasse Flode_Oya 2016 crop","filename":"Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","filesize":68543,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/highasakite_lasse-flode_oya-2016-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"highasakite_lasse-flode_oya-2016-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2016-02-02 11:52:27","modified":"2016-02-02 11:52:27","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop-300x188.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":188,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop-768x480.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":480,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":500,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":200,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":400,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/02/Highasakite_Lasse-Flode_Oya-2016-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":500}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2016/02/03/highasakite-will-headline-friday-12th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"31ce5d2e-a6cf-52dd-8d3d-c8be9108f9d6","locale":"en"}}
