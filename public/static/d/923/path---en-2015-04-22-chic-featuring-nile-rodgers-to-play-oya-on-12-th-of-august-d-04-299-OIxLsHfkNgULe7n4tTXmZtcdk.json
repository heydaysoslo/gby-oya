In recent years, he has collaborated with Disclosure, Sam Smith, Pharrell Williams and the aforementioned Daft Punk.</p>\n<p>With CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers, you are guaranteed to get in the best party mood and start dancing. The live set includes their big hits, like Le Freak and Good Times, and songs CHIC has helped to create. Expect a fantastic hit parade by the greatest dance music band of all time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/24/chic-nile-rodgers-review\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a> was very pleased when CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers played the 02 Academy in Glasgow in March: &#8211; The current CHIC live show seems like an extension of his personality: a two-hour cascade of influential disco, flawlessly delivered in cluster bombs of maxi-medleys. When this incarnation of CHIC is in full flight during I Want Your Love or My Forbidden Lover, it creates the not-unpleasant feeling of being steamrollered by a gigantic mirrorball.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nilerodgers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><b>www.nilerodgers.com</b></a></p>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2OXoSLANXIY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n","wordpress_id":5107,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/04/22/chic-featuring-nile-rodgers-to-play-oya-on-12th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7e756c34-6f40-57e9-8a99-7c109c912dd8","locale":"en"}}
