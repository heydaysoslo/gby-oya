{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Martin Hagfors to Øya","date":"21st December 2011","content":"<p>Martin Hagfors has been making music on his own and with others for many years. It is only recently that he has begun releasing records under his birth name. After listening to his last album, I Like You, we are expecting a very nice festival concert in August.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MARTIN HAGFORS</p>\n<p>Martin Hagfors is a man of many talents who has formed his career with several bands and projects throughout the years. Lately, he has been playing concerts and releasing records under his birth name. This year&#8217;s release is called I Like You, and amongst the contributors are Lars Horntveth, Kenneth Knapstad, Morten Qvenlid and Susanne Sundfør. His collaboration with producer Horntveth on both of his soloalbums has received a lot of praise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As well as being an artist, Hagfors has contributed as writer, guest musician and in the control room on numerous releases. You&#8217;ll find his contributions on records by Motorpsycho, Ida Jenshus, BigBang and The National Bank.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is with great pleasure that we invite Hagfors to play at The Øya Festival. his melodic americana-inspired and slightly psychy west coast sound will suit our warm summer park perfectly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.martinhagfors.com/home.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Hagfors online</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":1619,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2011/12/21/martin-hagfors-to-%c3%b8ya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"18511945-50ef-574e-9e9f-ba96d707178f","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
