They will play Øya Festival on Saturday 9<sup>th</sup> of August, the same date as yesterday’s big announcement, Slowdive.</p>\n<div>DARKSIDE (US)<br />\nNicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington started working together a few years ago, making music in their hotel during a joint European tour. After an EP and a digital remix of the latest Daft Punk album, they released the brilliant album Pshycic on Matador last fall. The record got very good reviews and made several important album-of-the-year-lists.</p>\n<div>\n<p>The Quietus wrote: &#8211; The sound of Psychic is meticulous and luscious. The beats are varied and creative, taking in thumping club kicks and swirling handclaps, and there are dubby, psychedelic soundscapes that, like Jaar’s solo material, feel architectural in their fastidious construction.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the last few months Darkside have sold out venues across Europe. On Saturday 9<sup>th</sup> of August they play in Tøyenparken. Don’t miss it!</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.darksideusa.com/\">http://www.darksideusa.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://otherpeople.net/\" target=\"_blank\">otherpeople.net</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/DarksideUSA\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/DarksideUSA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://facebook.com/DarksideUSA\" target=\"_blank\">facebook.com/DarksideUSA</a></p>\n</div>\n","wordpress_id":4179,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2014/02/06/darkside-to-play-oya-saturday-9th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ee9d86d1-4b0c-505e-9eaa-70bee8e492d0"}}
