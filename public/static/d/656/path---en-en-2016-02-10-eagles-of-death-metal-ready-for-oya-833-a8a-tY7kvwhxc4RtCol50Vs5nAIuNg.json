{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Eagles Of Death Metal ready for Øya","date":"10th February 2016","content":"<p><strong>EAGLES OF DEATH METAL (US) &#8211; Friday 12<sup>th</sup> of August</strong></p>\n<p>Eagles Of Death Metal are one of the most entertaining and fun rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll bands in the world. They are able to create a party no matter what weekday or time it is. Through four albums and countless tours they have spread good, fun songs based on equal parts boogie, glam and garage rock. NME wrote this about the latest album Zipper Down: &#8211; Sexy, fierce and occasionally very, very silly, this is an album made to be played on jukeboxes in backwater biker bars the world over, loudly.</p>\n<p>This band started as a collaboration between buddies Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme (Queens Of The Stone Age, Desert Sessions, Kyuss, Them Crooked Vultures +++). While they make the records as a duo, with the help of friends, it is Hughes who is in charge of the live version of the band, because Homme is often busy with other commitments. Joining Hughes on stage are musicians with backgrounds in such diverse rock bands as Masters Of Reality, earthlings ?, A Perfect Circle and The Whigs.</p>\n<p>Eagles Of Death Metal played Øya in 2007, shortly after their breakthrough in Norway. When we started planning this year&#8217;s festival early last fall, they were once again on our wish list. We are happy that the band decided to continue with music and spreading joy after the horrific events during their concert in Paris in November. In a few days they come back to Oslo, to finish the gigs of the tour that was cut short. Are you not one of the lucky few who have a ticket for the long sold-out show, we&#8217;ll give you another chance in Tøyenparken in August. This will be their only concert in Norway this summer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eaglesofdeathmetal.com/\">eaglesofdeathmetal.com</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":15676,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2016/02/10/eagles-of-death-metal-ready-for-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c95b023c-5dd6-5e79-88e1-740ad37f81c1","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
