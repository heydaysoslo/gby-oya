The new album, with contributions from Pharrell Williams (NERD/The Neptunes) and Dev Hynes (Lightspeed Champion/Blood Orange), will be out in 2013.</p>\n<div>\n<p>About Solange’s work with Hynes The Guardian recently wrote:<br />\n&#8211; Hynes has helped Solange find a distinctive sound: bittersweet, 80s-influenced soul, redolent at various points of Compass Point studios, early Madonna and even the spooky MOR of the Cars&#8217; Drive.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Solange&#8217;s second album, Sol-Angel &amp; The Hadley St. Dreams (2008), showed her potential as an artist on songs like I Decided, T.O.N.Y. and Sandcastle Disco. True EP was released digitally before Christmas and on CD and vinyl a short time ago. True gave some hints about what we can expect from the next release. NME was delighted and wrote:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Friends, meet Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister and the definition of pop perfection. The 26-year-old is not a hit-making pop star, but an antidote to pop homogenisation; something that sounds different to everything on the radio, but could still be on the radio. On that front, ‘True’ delivers.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the last few years, she has been working with Dirty Projectors, Of Montreal, Grizzly Bear, Chromeo, Theophilus London and Twin Shadow. Solange’s pop songs can be danceable, but still have a dark side. She is going to reach a much larger audience in 2013. We look forward to seeing her at Øya, and know that many are going to be captivated.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.solangemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.solangemusic.com/</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.solangemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.solangemusic.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>photo: Elias Tahan</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","wordpress_id":2950,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2013/01/21/solange-at-oya-thursday-8th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2f3f8769-554d-5263-89ee-cfcd145163be","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
