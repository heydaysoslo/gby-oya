{"data":{"wordpressPage":{"title":"Sustainability","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2002, it has been our goal at Øyafestivalen to be one of the world&#8217;s greenest events. For us, this means finding sustainable solutions for waste, food, transportation, energy and the things we buy &#8211; from toilet paper to power grids. We want our festival to contribute to a sustainable future &#8211; and work towards a festival that is fossile-free, plantbased and circular.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find the best solutions we measure, survey and report our environmental impact. We engage the entire organization to find ways to be more sustainable. This means a lot of experimenting, and sometimes failing. Therefore we want to be transparent &#8211; so that others can learn from our trials and errors.</p>\n<p>During the few weeks Øyafestivalen takes place in Tøyenparken, Oslo we feel it is like a small city. With roughly 20 000 inhabitants, offices, roads, toilets, restaurants, police officers, a library, street lights, renovation, nature, culture, bike parking, stores and meeting points. This makes our festival the perfect arena to showcase new technologies, and test new, sustainable solutions. We hope to use Tøyenparken as testing grounds for a new, sustainable future &#8211; and our goal is to inspire you as an audience, a fellow event organizer, a partner or as a business owner.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some main sustainability efforts at Øya:<br />\n&#8211; The festival has been run on renewable energy from the grid since 2009<br />\n&#8211; Over 90% of all food served is organic, and almost 40% of the 100 000 portions of food sold is meat-free<br />\n&#8211; Plastic-free food and drink serving: All food packaging is compostable (and is turned into biogas after the event) and all drinking beverages are reusable cups. This means since 2016, we have cut our use of plastic with 90%!<br />\n&#8211; All waste is handsorted in 15 different fractions and over 60% of the waste is reused for new products<br />\n&#8211; 98% of all audience arrive by walking, biking or using public transportation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions or feedback on our sustainability efforts- please contact our Sustainability Manager <a href=\"mailto:ingrid@oyafestivalen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ingrid Kleiva Møller</a></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","wordpress_id":19119,"locale":"en","slug":"sustainability","translations":{"nb":{"url":"/miljo/avfall/"},"en":{"url":"/en/environment/sustainability/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1b207182-dd87-5bed-be23-a138f265fa0f","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
