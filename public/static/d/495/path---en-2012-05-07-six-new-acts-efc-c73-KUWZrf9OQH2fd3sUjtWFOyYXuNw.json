The festival program will be completed in a few weeks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BEST COAST (US)</strong></p>\n<p>California band Best Coast are soon releasing their second album, called The Only Place. A short time ago, they released the song with the same name, which is about their feelings related to their home state. Just like their debut Crazy For You (2010) it seems like Best Coast are reminding us of everything that&#8217;s good about summer and making us savour that vacation feeling. This is high quality festive guitar pop. The new album has been produced by Jon Brion who has previously worked with Rufus Wainwright, Robyn Hitchcock, Evan Dando and Kanye West. The core of Best Coast is Bethany Cosentino and Bobb Bruno. Their new album apparently has a clearer and fuller sound. You can buy The Only Place on the 14th of May and you can see Best Coast live in the Medieval Park the 11th of August.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bestcoast.us/\" target=\"_blank\">www.bestcoast.us</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>ODD NORDSTOGA</strong></p>\n<p>For many years, The Øya Festival have had an artist who is dear to the Norwegian public opening the last day of the festival. Odd Nordstoga is the opening act on Saturday the 11th of August. Since his breakthrough with the album Luring in 2004, he has been one of our most popular performers within the borders of pop and folk music. Every album of his has been one of the top two on our sales lists ever since. He has also been given the Grammy award and is higly regarded as a live artist. We are looking forward to a great start to the Saturday at Øya with Odd Nordstoga starting at 13.00.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oddnordstoga.no/\" target=\"_blank\">www.oddnordstoga.no</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CHROMATICS (US)</strong></p>\n<p>Chromatics from the north west coast of USA released the album Kill For Love in March. Just like the previous record Night Drive (2007), it has recieved rave reviews from tough critics. Drowned In Sound said «This is a modern masterpiece, it’s as simple as that». You can see Chromatics live in the Medieval Park Friday the 10th of August.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Guitarist Adam Miller is the only original member. During recent years, multiinstrumentalist and producer Johnny Jewel, drummer Nat Walker and vocalist Ruth Radelet have made up the rest of the band. Chromatics mix cool synth pop with mysterious post punk. Last year, they made a very appropriate track for the film Drive. In addition to making very strong material of their own, they also manage to make great cover versions of songs by Kate Bush, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CHROMATICSBAND\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/CHROMATICSBAND</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vivaitalians.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">vivaitalians.blogspot.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>HERE WE GO MAGIC (US)</strong></p>\n<p>Here We Go Magic from New York is built around front man Luke Temple. Since his debut in 2009, this has gone from being a solo project to becoming a band. They have toured with quality bands like New Pornographers, The Walkmen and Grizzly Bear. They are releasing the album A Different Ship on Secretly Canadian. During the recording they have collaborated with Nigel Godrich, known for producing Radiohead, Pavement and Air. He discovered them at an early show at Glastonbury two years ago. The result of this collaboration is a more organic sound, recorded in London and Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Blog TrebleInTrouble.com has already heard the full album and describe it as follows:</p>\n<p>&#8211;        It’s a beautiful and melodic mixture of hypnosis, dramamine and a jolt of caffeine, a little bi-polar and a little schizophrenic–the band cultivates these qualities in purposeful movements, slowing guiding the listener between haze and anxiety.</p>\n<p>David Byrne, The Shins, Animal Collective and Deerhunter are some of the names mentioned when trying to place Here We Go Magic musically. If you don&#8217;t know the band already, we strongly recommend you come see them at Øya Thursday the 9th of August.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://herewegomagicband.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">herewegomagicband.tumblr.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>HEDVIG MOLLESTAD TRIO</strong></p>\n<p>Hedvig Mollestad Thomassen is a guitarist with a wide musical background. Last year, she released the album Shoot! with her trio. The two others in this impressive trio are bass player Ellen Brekken and drummer Ivar Loe Bjørnstad. Together they make music that mixes jazz with progressive rock. The instrumental record has recieved good reviews both here and abroad. Mojo and Uncut are two of the top music media that have appreciated the record. The latter said that he album «carves a riff-ridged canyon through a landscape stalked by the ghosts of Jimi Hendrix, Sabbath and Goblin».</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hedvig herself has played with Jarle Bernhoft and Hilde-Marie Kjersem and been part of the bands VOM and Bronco Busters. As well as playing with her own trio at Øya, you can catch her performing with El Doom &amp; The Born Electric. We are highly excited about both shows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/hedvigmollestadtrio\" target=\"_blank\">www.myspace.com/hedvigmollestadtrio</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>SWEDEN</strong></p>\n<p>One of our favourite albums from this spring comes from a Norwegian band called, funnily enough, Sweden. The names is traced back to their daydreaming about taking trips over the border to shop cheap goods when they were young, not to mention listening to the great indie rock and power pop of our neighbours. They namedrop Popsicle, Brainpool and their peers often enough. The core of Sweden are Christian Spro and Fredrik Gretland. They have names like The Cumshots and Beezewax on their musical CV&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The album Under The Sycamore Tree was released in March. This record is filled to the brim with catchy pop melodies performed with steady guitars. Even though Sweden&#8217;s music makes you need cold drinks and warm sunshine there is a slight melancholy to the songs. We have soon worn out our first copy of this great album here at the Øya offices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/swedentheband\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/swedentheband</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"2012-05-07T12:03:49.000Z","wordpress_id":15662,"featured_image":{"title":"best coast -  david black  øyafestivalen 2012 635x350","filename":"best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","filesize":171552,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/best-coast-david-black-oyafestivalen-2012-635x350-2-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"best-coast-david-black-oyafestivalen-2012-635x350-2-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2012-05-06 20:45:43","modified":"2012-05-06 20:45:43","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/05/best-coast-david-black-yafestivalen-2012-635x3501.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/05/07/six-new-acts/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8e9271e9-7942-5e08-88ab-180c1ff6e4df","locale":"en"}}
