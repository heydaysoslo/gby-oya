He is coming to Tøyenparken on Friday 14<sup>th</sup> of August to headline our main stage.</p>\n<p>2014 was a good year for Beck, almost like he had a breakthrough once more. He got four Grammy nominations, and did a lot of big shows, including the huge Coachella festival. Morning Phase received praise from the media and became album of the year in Mojo.</p>\n<p><strong>BECK (US)</strong><br />\nBeck is one of the most exciting pop musicians in the last few decades. His music ranges from lively danceable pop and rock to melancholy folk songs.</p>\n<p>Growing up, he fell in love with both hip hop and folk, which may explain his sound. Beck’s songs are a bit like a collision between the traditional and the modern. Classic albums like Mellow Gold (1994) and Odelay (1996) established him as one of the most important artists of his generation. His latest album Morning Phase (2014) has a certain kinship to the mellow and melancholy favorite Sea Change (2002), an album that went to number one in the Norwegian sales charts. He has several gold and platinum discs, and has received a number of prestigious awards, including three Grammys and six MTV Video Music Award.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/odelay-mw0000647922\" target=\"_blank\">Allmusic.com</a> has written the following about the classic Odelay: &#8211; Like a mosaic, all the details add up to a picture greater than its parts, so while some of Beck&#8217;s best songs are here, Odelay is best appreciated as a recorded whole, with each layered sample enhancing the allusion that came before.</p>\n<p>Hits like Devil&#8217;s Haircut, Loser, E-Pro and Sexx Laws are still regular features in his set list. We know all his Norwegian fans are looking forward to seeing him on stage again. He has not been in Norway for seven years and it is nine years since he last played in Oslo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beck.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.beck.com</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":4919,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/01/20/beck-added-to-oya-line-up/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fe7e4152-bc28-54a2-895c-60da2a73c6c0"}}
