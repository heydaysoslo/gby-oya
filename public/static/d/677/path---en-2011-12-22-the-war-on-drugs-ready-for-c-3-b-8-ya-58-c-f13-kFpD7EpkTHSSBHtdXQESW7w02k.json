In August, the band behind the great album Slave Ambient is coming to Oslo to play at The Øya Festival. This will be their very first concert in Norway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>THE WAR ON DRUGS (US)</p>\n<p>American The War On Drugs have been one of the hottest new names lately. The band from Philadelphia released their second album Slave Ambient on Secretly Canadian in August. The record was named &#8220;Best New Music&#8221; by Pitchfork the same month. Paste Magazine called it the strongest album of the year. The band is now coming to The Øya Festival to share their great tunes with an excited Oslo audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paste Magazine wrote: «I know seeing city lights emerge out of a setting sun while listening to this thing will bring that rush of euphoria we listen to music for in the first place. The War on Drugs are hopelessly in love with that feeling, and even knowing how intangible it is, they write songs thoroughly designed to get them there. It works,<em> Slave Ambient </em>makes you feel good, and I’m glad that’s all they ever wanted.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The much-talked about Kurt Vile used to be part of The War On Drugs. After prioritising his solo career, Adam Granduciel is now the leader of the band. The War On Drugs play a mix of modern indie rock and traditional americana. This is great festival music that will warm you as much as the sunlight in August.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thewarondrugs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">www.thewarondrugs.net</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":15651,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2011/12/22/the-war-on-drugs-ready-for-%c3%b8ya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"74561b2b-2e42-54b0-9f45-3a52e3444a09","locale":"en"}}
