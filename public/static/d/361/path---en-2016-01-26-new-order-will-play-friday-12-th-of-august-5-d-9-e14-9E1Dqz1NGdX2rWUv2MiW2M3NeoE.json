Their albums have inspired countless artists in synth, rock and club music. Last year’s Music Complete showed that this is still a band in great form.</p>\n<p>New Order are original members Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert, plus Paul Cunningham and newcomer Paul Chapman. The first two were also founding members of the gloomy post-punk pioneers Joy Division. New Order’s best songs include classics such as True Faith and Blue Monday, and newer highlights like Crystal and Restless.
