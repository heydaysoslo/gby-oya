{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"First artists ready for Øya 2012","date":"29th November 2011","content":"<p>True to tradition, The Øya Festival will be releasing the first tickets and revealing our new festival design on the 1st of December.</p>\n<p>We are now revealing the first group of artists playing on our main stages. Amongst them are two of our most prominent singer/songwriters at the moment, Ane Brun and Jonas Alaska. We are also getting some great hip hop from Yeawolf and dark rock from The Devil&#8217;s Blood.</p>\n<p>These are the first two of our exciting international bookings for The Øya Festival 2012. Their gigs at Øya will be the first live shows these two play following their upcoming album releases. We have also made room for two Norwegian acts that have not yet played at our festival. The Duo Sudan Dudan will be playing with the boundaries of Norwegian folk music in the Oslo sunshine, whilst The Good, The Bad &amp; The Zugly are going to show us what&#8217;s what when it comes to punk rock.</p>\n<p>We will soon be releasing more artists for The Øya Festival 2012. Watch out for exclusive concerts and more fabulous artists.
