Through four eventful days in the Medieval Park and a huge amount of club shows, thousands of people enjoyed great music. The concerts have been well attended throughout the festival. Our audience really knows how to create a good atmosphere. The last two days we have also had some of this year&#8217;s finest summer days. It has been a wonderful festival from Tuesdays club shows to Sondre Lerche&#8217;s opening concert in the park to Bon Iver’s and Karpe Diem’s closing shows.</p>\n<p>We have gotten great feedback from the audience and performers. There are numerous good reviews of the concerts at Øya 2012. This is very inspiring, as we will soon start the first preparations for next year&#8217;s festival.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to thank volunteers, artists, audiences and partners for the most fantastic working week we can remember. Our goal was to make the best Øya ever, and we believe we did just that. This year&#8217;s festival must have beaten the Norwegian record in the festival fun.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>foto: Ihne Pedersen</p>\n","wordpress_id":2753,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/08/13/thank-you-see-you-next-year/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1b0d8328-8359-57e2-bca7-476334239a6a"}}
