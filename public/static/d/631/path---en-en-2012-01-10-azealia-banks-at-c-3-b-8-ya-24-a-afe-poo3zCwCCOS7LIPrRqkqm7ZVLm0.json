{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Azealia Banks at Øya","date":"10th January 2012","content":"<p>Azealia Banks was recently in first place on NME&#8217;s annual cool list. This hiphop artist will definitely be on many people&#8217;s lips next year. We look forward to presenting her at Øya.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AZEALIA BANKS (US)</p>\n<p>The coolest person on the planet anno 2011, and thus one of the names associated with great expectations for 2012 is a 20-year-old musical lover and rapper-slash-singer from Harlem. The sassy Azealia Banks recently made it to the very top of NME&#8217;s Cool List, where she throned above names like eternally cool veteran Jarvis Cocker and the controversial pop comet Lana Del Rey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Banks, who has been playing in Off-Broadway shows since she was a child, first caught the attention of the music press when she at 17 put her blushingly bold lines of text over a remix of Ladytrons &#8220;Seventeen&#8221;. Last year, she made a cool freestyle for a Nike-ad and the Fader-favourite &#8220;L8R&#8221;, before demonstrating that she is just as good a vocalist as a rapper with her emotional interpretation of Interpol&#8217;s &#8220;Slow Hands&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s this year&#8217;s banger &#8220;212&#8221;, with rhymes so &#8220;adult&#8221; that we hope her mother have not heard them, which proves that her final breakthrough is both imminent and inevitable. What a catchy tune! And what a video!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Azealia Banks will soon be moving to London to complete her debut album with producer Paul Epworth (Florence And The Machine, Adele), and to play more than a dozen highly anticipated concerts in the UK. &#8220;Everyone&#8221; wanted to see her when she made an exclusive appearance during CMJ in New York earlier this autumn. The Øya delegates managed to get in and were so convinced by the short and concise set that we immediately started working to get her to Oslo in August. It is now our pleasure to announce that Azealia Bank is coming to the Øya Festival!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://azealiabanksforever.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AZEALIA BANKS FOREVER</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":1643,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/01/10/azealia-banks-at-%c3%b8ya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ab1cd5d3-35ba-51fd-b55f-b8a8732e9d81","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
