The new album, with contributions from Pharrell Williams (NERD/The Neptunes) and Dev Hynes (Lightspeed Champion/Blood Orange), will be out in 2013.</p>\n<div>\n<p>About Solange’s work with Hynes The Guardian recently wrote:<br />\n&#8211; Hynes has helped Solange find a distinctive sound: bittersweet, 80s-influenced soul, redolent at various points of Compass Point studios, early Madonna and even the spooky MOR of the Cars&#8217; Drive.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Solange&#8217;s second album, Sol-Angel &amp; The Hadley St. Dreams (2008), showed her potential as an artist on songs like I Decided, T.O.N.Y. and Sandcastle Disco. True EP was released digitally before Christmas and on CD and vinyl a short time ago. True gave some hints about what we can expect from the next release. NME was delighted and wrote:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Friends, meet Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister and the definition of pop perfection. The 26-year-old is not a hit-making pop star, but an antidote to pop homogenisation; something that sounds different to everything on the radio, but could still be on the radio. On that front, ‘True’ delivers.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the last few years, she has been working with Dirty Projectors, Of Montreal, Grizzly Bear, Chromeo, Theophilus London and Twin Shadow. Solange’s pop songs can be danceable, but still have a dark side. She is going to reach a much larger audience in 2013. We look forward to seeing her at Øya, and know that many are going to be captivated.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.solangemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.solangemusic.com/</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.solangemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.solangemusic.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>photo: Elias Tahan</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"2013-01-21T09:54:50.000Z","wordpress_id":2950,"featured_image":{"title":"Solange-Press-EliasTahan øyafestivalen 2013 635x350","filename":"Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","filesize":179119,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/solange-press-eliastahan-oyafestivalen-2013-635x350-2-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"solange-press-eliastahan-oyafestivalen-2013-635x350-2-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2013-01-18 12:36:08","modified":"2013-01-18 12:36:08","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/Solange-Press-EliasTahan-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2013/01/21/solange-at-oya-thursday-8th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2f3f8769-554d-5263-89ee-cfcd145163be","locale":"en"}}
