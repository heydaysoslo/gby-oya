This will be their only concert in Norway this year, and also their first in Oslo since 1981.</p>\n<p>NEW ORDER (UK)</p>\n<p>With a background in post-punk, New Order from Manchester have been crucial for the development of British pop and rock since the early 80s. Their albums have inspired countless artists in synth, rock and club music. Last year’s Music Complete showed that this is still a band in great form.</p>\n<p>New Order are original members Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert, plus Paul Cunningham and newcomer Paul Chapman. The first two were also founding members of the gloomy post-punk pioneers Joy Division. New Order’s best songs include classics such as True Faith and Blue Monday, and newer highlights like Crystal and Restless. We know also that they like to play a few songs by Joy Division, like Atmosphere and Love Will Tear Us Apart.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixmag.net/read/new-order-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">Mixmag</a> about the latest album: &#8211; … an album of outstanding pop, shuddering dance-rock and intricate electronic moods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/review-new-order-warehouse-project-10556320\" target=\"_blank\">Manchester Evening News</a>: &#8211; …the important thing about New Order&#8217;s music: it was written to be moved to, not to stare at.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/new-order-brixton-academy-review-slick-and-confident-performance-from-music-legends-who-remain-a6737926.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Independent</a> was at one of their shows last fall: &#8211; This was a slick and confident performance from music legends that are still staying current with fresh music, I just wished they had played more of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.neworder.com/\">www.neworder.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>photo Nick Wilson</p>\n","wordpress_id":5790,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2016/01/26/new-order-will-play-friday-12th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"de3eb8b2-fce9-5c87-948d-ed2c27b7c624","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
