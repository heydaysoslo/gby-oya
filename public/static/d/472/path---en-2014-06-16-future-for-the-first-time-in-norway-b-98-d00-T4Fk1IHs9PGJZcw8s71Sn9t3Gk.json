This will be his first concert in Europe after the release of this year&#8217;s critically acclaimed album Honest, which went to munber two on the Billboard album chart. With Outkast, Janelle Monae, Blood Orange, Kaveh, Yoguttene and Jungle already confirmed for the Thursday, the booking of   Future might make this day the best ever urban lineup at Øya.</p>\n<p>New RnB hope Kelela replaces FKA Twigs, who unfortunately has been forced to cancel, the following day. On Saturday you can check out new Norwegian electro pop from Sea Change.</p>\n<p>There are currently a few day tickets left for Thursday and Saturday. Wednesday is not far behind. Week passes and tickets for Friday are sold out.</p>\n<p>FUTURE (US)<br />\nFuture released the album Honest earlier this year. It rose all the way to second place on the Billboard chart. Now he is coming to Scandinavia for the first time, and starts his visit at Øya. Future, who is from Outkast’s hometown Atlanta, started his career with a handful of mixtapes. In 2012 he had a breakthrough with his debut album Pluto. The same year, he was featured on Lil Wayne&#8217;s hit Love Me.</p>\n<p>About the new album Fact stated that «if there’s anyone that can mix — with equal efficacy — rap and R&amp;B, bangers and ballads, the street and the bedroom, it’s Future».</p>\n<p>Honest got very good reception in Norway. We expect that he will get people to work up a sweat in our tent stage Sirkus.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.futurefreebandz.com/\">http://www.futurefreebandz.com/</a></p>\n<p>KELELA (US)<br />\nKelela Mizanekristos debuted in 2013 with the mix tape Cut 4 Me. Shortly after she was on BBC’s “sound of 2014”-list. The LA-based artist mix experimental and futuristic R &amp; B with electronica. Kelela is inspired by 90’s R &amp; B &#8211; and has described her own sound as &#8220;Brandy, just weirder&#8221;. She is currently working on new material.</p>\n<p>Kelelas parents came to the US from Ethiopia. Media in both Europe, North America and Africa show interest in her music. Allafrica.com believes she is &#8220;One to watch in 2014&#8221;, and wrote: &#8211; Her sound is eerie yet calming, and petrifyingly emotive. Hard electronic sounds are juxtaposed with her honey sweet voice. Perhaps, one could call it R&amp;B-electro pop, but that description does not seem to be sufficient.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kelelamusic\">https://www.facebook.com/kelelamusic</a></p>\n<p>SEA CHANGE<br />\nFew young Norwegian artists have received as much attention in international media recently as Berlin-based Sea Change. Ellen A.W. Sunde, her real name, is mentioned in the most flattering terms by The Guardian, Drowned In Sound, NME and The Line Of Best Fit.  She is praised for her delicate and cool electronica. Sea Change’s sound is somewhat similar to Nordic peers like Robyn, Lykke Li, Sandra Kolstad and Fever Ray. The debut album is expected this fall.</p>\n<p>The Guardian has described her music like this: &#8211; She specialises in electronic pop notable for its chilly atmospherics and spectral vocals, pitched high &#8211; literally and in terms of fever. But this is emotion recollected in devastated tranquility: the quiet after the emotional storm.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.seachange.no\">www.seachange.no</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","wordpress_id":4580,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2014/06/16/future-for-the-first-time-in-norway/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0bf34a23-ff7b-5cd7-9146-acf26eb1c147","locale":"en"}}
