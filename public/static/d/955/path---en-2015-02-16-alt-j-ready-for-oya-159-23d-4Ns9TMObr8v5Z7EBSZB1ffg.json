Look out for exciting news every week. The British sensation Alt-J are ready to play Tøyenparken on Friday the 14th of August, the same day as, among others Beck, ILoveMakonnen and Future Islands.</p>\n<p>It is now less than 2,000 week pass left for this year’s Øyafestival. Day tickets are also on sale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ALT J (UK)<br />\nAlt-J from Leeds are about to reach the premier league of British bands. The fan base is constantly growing, something they ensured with the album This Is All Yours last fall. Their modern, melancholic and sophisticated songs have reched out to a large audience, while being far from the boring pop music you normally find in the charts. The album went all the way to number one in the UK and reached the top five in countries like USA, Canada, Ireland, France and Australia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nme.com/reviews/alt-j/15628\" target=\"_blank\">NME about Alt-J</a>: Wrapping monkish tunes – hushed because they weren’t allowed drums and bass in their student halls while writing it – in minutely crafted electronics and sparse, tribal harmonies, it sounded like an electropop Fabergé egg; precise, ornate and crafted by master laptop artisans.</p>\n<p>Their debut album An Awesome Wave was released in 2012, and the band won the acclaimed Mercury Prize. Alt-J have played many of the world&#8217;s largest and most important festivals. We are very pleased that they will play our intimate festival this August.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.altjband.com/\">http://www.altjband.com/</a></p>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dCCXq9QB-dQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n","date":"2015-02-16T09:03:08.000Z","wordpress_id":15672,"featured_image":{"title":"alt j oyafestivalen 2015 crop","filename":"alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","filesize":293639,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2015-02-15 12:45:41","modified":"2015-02-15 12:45:41","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-300x150.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":150,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-768x384.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":384,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":400,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":160,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":320,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/02/alt-j-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":400}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/02/16/alt-j-ready-for-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"91565143-3f42-5be9-ba17-ade32002aa65","locale":"en"}}
