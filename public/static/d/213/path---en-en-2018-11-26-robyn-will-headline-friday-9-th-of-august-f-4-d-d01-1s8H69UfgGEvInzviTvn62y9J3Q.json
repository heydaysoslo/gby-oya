The new successful album Honey was released in October and went straight to second place in the Norwegian charts. Robyn is a fantastic live artist, an industry-leading pioneer and a great inspiration for many.</p>\n<p>She started her international pop career with songs like Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect) and Show Me Love in the mid 90&#8217;s.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her self-titled album from 2005, showed a more mature musician. With songs like Be Mine, Who&#8217;s That Girl? and With Every Heartbeat she was in the charts all over the world. In 2010 she began a bold project releasing three EPs in a year. The Body Talk collection is packed with hits – and received great acclaim. In 2014, she collaborated with Röyksopp on the mini-album Do It Again. The following year she released an EP together with keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and now deceased producer Christian Falk, using the name La Bagatelle Magique.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now she is back with new songs and a fantastic liveshow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robyn/\">www.facebook.com/robyn</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":22856,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2018/11/26/robyn-will-headline-friday-9th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"13e32c46-1897-5e71-80d4-ce50e7416240","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
