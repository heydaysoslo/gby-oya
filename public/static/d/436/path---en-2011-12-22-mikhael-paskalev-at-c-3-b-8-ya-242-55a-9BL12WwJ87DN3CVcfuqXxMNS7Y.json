We are excited, and so is the artist himself. We predict that his fangroup will grow considerably during the next nine months.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MIKHAEL PASKALEV</p>\n<p>Every year, the Øya Festival picks out a few artists who made an impression at the Club Day the previous year. This time, Mikhael Paskalev will be playing his first gig in the park, in front of a large Øya-audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paskalev writes great songs in the musical landscape between americana and indie pop. He says his inspiration comes from the likes of Paul Simon, The Shins and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. His songs are wonderfully catchy and they have the ability to become favourites rather quickly. Try I Spy for instance. He has started working on his debut album which he plans to release after The Øya Festival. Expect lovely festival tunes, suitable for the Oslo park life.</p>\n","date":"2011-12-22T09:57:10.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"Mikhael Paskalev_Øyafestivalen_635x350","filename":"Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","filesize":125858,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/mikhael-paskalev_oyafestivalen_635x350-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"mikhael-paskalev_oyafestivalen_635x350-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2013-03-21 10:55:31","modified":"2013-03-21 10:55:31","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/03/Mikhael-Paskalevyafestivalen635x350.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2011/12/22/mikhael-paskalev-at-%c3%b8ya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"61593c8a-8dfc-5604-9efc-91f56d18edc9","locale":"en"}}
