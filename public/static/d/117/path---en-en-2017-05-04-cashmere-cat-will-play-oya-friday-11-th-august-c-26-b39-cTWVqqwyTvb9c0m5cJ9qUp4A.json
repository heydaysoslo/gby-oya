He’s just released his debut album, 9, and critics applaud it.</p>\n<p>P.Basler from DBK: “With plinking, whirling synthesizers, scattered, bouncy percussion and layers and layers of some of pop and R&amp;B’s biggest names, it’s an album that has all the perfect ingredients and then some. In some ways, it’s like a weird, hazy version of Now That’s What I Call Music!, a compilation of today’s biggest pop stars filtered through the creative imagination of Norway’s most prolific producer.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.oyafestivalen.no/program/#!programmation=artist$cashmere-cat/87\">ABOUT CASHMERE CAT</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":19883,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2017/05/04/cashmere-cat-will-play-oya-friday-11th-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"291390f3-6815-57d9-b926-44fa499396d2","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
