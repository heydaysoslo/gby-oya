Inspired by the bells in Oslo City Hall, they came up with the challenge to the German producer to make music for a 3-ton carillon and a percussionist ensemble.</p>\n<p>The others who are involved in the project are Lars Petter Hagen (Norwegian composer and head of the Ultima Festival), Martin Horntveth (Jaga Jazzist), Erland Dahlen (Madrugada and Nils Petter Molvær), Heming Valebjørg (Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra), Håkon Stene and Vegar Sandholt (plays carillon at City Hall in Oslo).</p>\n<p>The album called Elements of Light took shape over several months of work in Berlin and Oslo. The project was eventually named Pantha Du Prince &amp; The Bell Laboratory. The name plays at Bell Laboratories, the telephone funded studio that developed some of the first electronic music.</p>\n<p>The first concert took place in front of a packed Klubben stage during the Øya Festival in 2011. Present in the tent was Geoff Travis of Rough Trade who decided to sign the project and to give it a full-scale international release.</p>\n<p>Pantha Du Prince &amp; The Bell Laboratory has played in several European cities. Recently they played sold out concert halls in Hamburg, and in The Hague under Todays Art festival.</p>\n<p>The album will be released on 15<sup>th</sup> of January on Rough Trade Records</p>\n","date":"2012-10-31T08:56:51.000Z","featured_image":{"title":"bell lab 635x350","filename":"bell-lab-635x350.jpg","filesize":118839,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/bell-lab-635x350-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"bell-lab-635x350-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2012-10-26 09:15:44","modified":"2012-10-26 09:15:44","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/10/bell-lab-635x350.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/10/31/pantha-du-prince-the-bell-laboratory-released-on-rough-trade/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c058aeec-3d23-5b2d-8585-5fdfab0f9625","locale":"en"}}
