She has previously played our festival in 2008 and 2011. The concert in 2008 was her first ever outside the US, and she was the great surprise of that year’s line-up. In 2011, her debut album The ArchAndroid was out and thousands showed up for one of the greatest hours in Øya history. In August she will play our main stage, something she deserves after the successful album The Electric Lady. The album was released last year, and peaked at number five on the US album chart.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What a wild and wonderful listening experience this is&#8221; The Daily Telegraph wrote in their review of The Electric Lady. They also stated: &#8220;Now this dazzling, daring, psychedelic funk pop opus puts Monáe firmly in the front rank of 21st-century stars&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Janelle Monáe is considered a future superstar by many. We promise you a fantastic party when Janelle walks out on stage in Tøyenparken. Whether you like soul, classic or new RnB, good pop or just moving your body to good music, she is exactly what you want to see and hear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jmonae.com/\">http://www.jmonae.com/</a></p>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tEddixS-UoU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>photo Marc Baptiste</p>\n","wordpress_id":4151,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2014/01/16/janelle-monae-at-oya-7th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"07ba34fe-fac1-5ae4-9bab-72889e253729","locale":"en"}}
