The album is a bit more straightforward than we are are used to from the band, but still they are in a class of their own both as songwriters and musicians. The band has a very loyal fan base in Norway, which among other things has resulted in the last three albums reaching top 10 in the charts.</p>\n<p>Spin Magazine: &#8211; Their brand of aggression is brainy, technically dazzling and slightly hallucinogenic — metal for people who don&#8217;t listen to metal.

Mastodon’s first album was Remission from 2002. Their following grew with the concept albums Leviathan (2004), Blood Mountain (2006), Crack The Skye (2009) and The Hunter (2011).
