On Friday the 9<sup>th</sup> of August they come to Oslo to headline The Øya Festival. This will be one of the biggest shows The Medieval Park has ever seen, with special screens and projectors for a full 3D experience.</p>\n<p>There are now only day tickets left for the festival and we expect that the news that Kraftwerk will play, will mean a significant ticket sales for Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>KRAFTWERK (DE)</strong><br />\nKraftwerk was founded in Düsseldorf in the beginning of the 70&#8217;s and since the international success of the album Autobahn (1974) they have been considered as electronic music&#8217;s leading band. With the albums Trans-Europe Express (1977), The Man Machine (1978) and Computer World (1981), they established themselves as a sort of everlasting source of inspiration for contemporary music. The music of Kraftwerk has inspired such big names as David Bowie, Björk, Depeche Mode and a huge number of young musicians in various styles.</p>\n<p>&#8211;        <em>Trans-Europe Express</em>, mapped out the blueprint for electro and techno<em> (&#8230;) The Man-Machine</em>, secured what Simon Reynolds has called the group’s ‘ancestral centrality’ for synthpop. (Drowned In Sound)</p>\n<p>Kraftwerk is led by founder Ralf Hütter. He is responsible for what is still seen as all electronic pop music’s very vital and ever-important godfathers. Recently they played eight nights at the Tate Modern in London. They played the entire album catalog, something they also have done in their hometown. When they get to Øya, they will give us the highlights from most of their career, and they bring their amazing 3D show. We promise you a concert out of the ordinary and a chance to experience a true pop phenomenon.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.kraftwerk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.kraftwerk.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>photo <strong>PETER BOETTCHER</strong></p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fd7ebfba-806b-502f-b6c1-6d7878819576"}}
