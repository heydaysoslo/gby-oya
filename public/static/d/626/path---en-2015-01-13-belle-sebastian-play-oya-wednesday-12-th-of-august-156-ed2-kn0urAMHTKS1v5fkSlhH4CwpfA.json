Now they are back with a new album, and in August the will play Øya. We know there are a lot of Norwegian fans looking forward to see the band in Tøyenparken on Wednesday 12 August.</p>\n<p>BELLE &amp; SEBASTIAN (UK)</p>\n<p>Belle &amp; Sebastian is a band we have wanted to present at Øya for years, and we are happy to book them now that they are back with a great album. Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance will be released on January 19th. Based on the singles we have heard in the last few months, we predict that you will find quite a few new favorite summer songs on their new album. Stuart Murdoch still proves to be one of the greatest British songwriters.</p>\n<p>Their kind of melancholic indie pop has been imitated by many. Some critics have categorized the music as chamber pop, folk pop or twee pop. The band was formed in Glasgow in the mid-90s. In 1996 they released two albums, Tigermilk and If You&#8217;re Feeling Sinister.  With their fourth album Fold Your Hands Child You Walk Like A Peasant (2000) the got in to the top ten in the UK album charts for the first time. They have not released a new album since Write About Love in the fall of 2010, making it the longest time in between albums in the band’s history.</p>\n<p>Allmusic.com describes their sound in the review of the classic If You&#8217;re Feeling Sinister : &#8211; Whimsy and preciousness are an integral part of If You&#8217;re Feeling Sinister, along with clever wit and gentle, intricate arrangements &#8212; a wonderful blend of the Smiths and Simon &amp; Garfunkel, to be reductive. Even if it&#8217;s firmly within the college, bed-sit tradition, and is unabashedly retrogressive, that gives Sinister a special, timeless character that&#8217;s enhanced by Stuart Murdoch&#8217;s wonderful, lively songwriting.</p>\n<p>Belle &amp; Sebastian have a lot of loyal fans in Norway. On Øya, we hope to hear new songs, along with favourites like I&#8217;m A Cuckoo, Legal Man, The Boy With The Arab Strap and Get Me Away From Here, I&#8217;m Dying.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.belleandsebastian.com/\">http://www.belleandsebastian.com/</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":4929,"featured_image":{"title":"belle sebastian oyafestivalen 2015 crop","filename":"belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","filesize":133810,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2015-01-12 09:31:33","modified":"2015-01-12 09:31:33","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-300x150.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":150,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-768x384.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":384,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":400,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":160,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":320,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/01/belle-sebastian-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":400}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/01/13/belle-sebastian-play-oya-wednesday-12th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"960f6635-0afa-54d8-ac47-1df08e096175","locale":"en"}}
