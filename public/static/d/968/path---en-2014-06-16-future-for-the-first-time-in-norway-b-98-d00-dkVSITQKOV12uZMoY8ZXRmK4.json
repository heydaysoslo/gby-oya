August</strong></p>\n<p>Hiphop sensation Future is coming to Scandinavia for the first time in August and will play Øya on the 7<sup>th</sup> of August. This will be his first concert in Europe after the release of this year&#8217;s critically acclaimed album Honest, which went to munber two on the Billboard album chart. With Outkast, Janelle Monae, Blood Orange, Kaveh, Yoguttene and Jungle already confirmed for the Thursday, the booking of   Future might make this day the best ever urban lineup at Øya.</p>\n<p>New RnB hope Kelela replaces FKA Twigs, who unfortunately has been forced to cancel, the following day. On Saturday you can check out new Norwegian electro pop from Sea Change.</p>\n<p>There are currently a few day tickets left for Thursday and Saturday. Wednesday is not far behind. Week passes and tickets for Friday are sold out.</p>\n<p>FUTURE (US)<br />\nFuture released the album Honest earlier this year. It rose all the way to second place on the Billboard chart. Now he is coming to Scandinavia for the first time, and starts his visit at Øya. Future, who is from Outkast’s hometown Atlanta, started his career with a handful of mixtapes. In 2012 he had a breakthrough with his debut album Pluto. The same year, he was featured on Lil Wayne&#8217;s hit Love Me.</p>\n<p>About the new album Fact stated that «if there’s anyone that can mix — with equal efficacy — rap and R&amp;B, bangers and ballads, the street and the bedroom, it’s Future».</p>\n<p>Honest got very good reception in Norway.

Allafrica.com believes she is &#8220;One to watch in 2014&#8221;, and wrote: &#8211; Her sound is eerie yet calming, and petrifyingly emotive.
