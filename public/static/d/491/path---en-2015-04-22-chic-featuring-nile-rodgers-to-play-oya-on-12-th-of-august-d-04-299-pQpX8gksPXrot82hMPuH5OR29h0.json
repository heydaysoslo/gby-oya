The single I&#8217;ll Be There is out now, and will give you a good taste of the party in Tøyenparken when CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers will headline our great Wednesday line-up.</p>\n<p>Nile Rodgers has reached a new audience in the last few years, partly because of his contribution to Daft Punk’s 2013 album Random Access Memories. He started CHIC with Bernard Edwards, and at the end of the 70s, their albums went platinum and the singles topped the charts. Rodgers is a Grammy award winning composer, guitarist, arranger and producer who has influenced pop music for decades.</p>\n<p>CHIC is probably the most sampled band in history, and their impact goes far beyond disco and pop. Nile Rodgers has produced successful recordings with David Bowie, Madonna, Diana Ross, Sister Sledge, Duran Duran, Mick Jagger, Grace Jones, B-52s and many others. In recent years, he has collaborated with Disclosure, Sam Smith, Pharrell Williams and the aforementioned Daft Punk.</p>\n<p>With CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers, you are guaranteed to get in the best party mood and start dancing. The live set includes their big hits, like Le Freak and Good Times, and songs CHIC has helped to create. Expect a fantastic hit parade by the greatest dance music band of all time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/24/chic-nile-rodgers-review\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a> was very pleased when CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers played the 02 Academy in Glasgow in March: &#8211; The current CHIC live show seems like an extension of his personality: a two-hour cascade of influential disco, flawlessly delivered in cluster bombs of maxi-medleys. When this incarnation of CHIC is in full flight during I Want Your Love or My Forbidden Lover, it creates the not-unpleasant feeling of being steamrollered by a gigantic mirrorball.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nilerodgers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><b>www.nilerodgers.com</b></a></p>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2OXoSLANXIY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n","date":"2015-04-22T06:48:31.000Z","wordpress_id":5107,"featured_image":{"title":"chic nile rodgers oyafestivalen 2015 crop","filename":"chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","filesize":189008,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2015-04-20 07:50:16","modified":"2015-04-20 07:50:16","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-300x188.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":188,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop-768x480.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":480,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":500,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":200,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":400,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2015/04/chic-nile-rodgers-oyafestivalen-2015-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":500}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/04/22/chic-featuring-nile-rodgers-to-play-oya-on-12th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7e756c34-6f40-57e9-8a99-7c109c912dd8","locale":"en"}}
