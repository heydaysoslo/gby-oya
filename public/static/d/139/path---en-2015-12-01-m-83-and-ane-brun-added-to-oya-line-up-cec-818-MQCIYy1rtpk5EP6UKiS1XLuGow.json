They will play Øya for the first time on Wednesday 10th of August. M83 was formed on the French south coast in 2001. Their dreamy pop noticed abroad after the second album Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts. Since the other founder left M83 after two albums, it has mainly been Anthony Gonzalez&#8217;s project. M83s atmospheric electronic pop can be difficult to describe in a few words, but it has elements of synth, ambient and new wave.</p>\n<p>The commercial breakthrough came in 2011, when Hurry Up, We&#8217;re Dreaming was nominated for a Grammy, and rose in the charts in several countries. The single Midnight City helped a much larger audience notice M83.</p>\n<p>They have remixed Depeche Mode, Goldfrapp and Bloc Party, and toured with Killers, Kings Of Leon and the aforementioned Depeche Mode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/05/live-review-m83-at-chicagos-riviera-theatre-54/\" target=\"_blank\">Counsequence Of Sound</a>: &#8211; M83 has become a juggernaut on the concert circuit, brandishing a style of dream pop that’s evolved into a cultural phenomenon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/8824818/M83-Hurry-Up-Were-Dreaming-CD-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Daily Telegraph</a>: &#8211; On top of booming synth-pop templates, his cosmic compositions arch off in weird directions, incorporating blues-bar sax solos, Afrobeat slap bass, swooping strings, psychedelic imagery and – really – a children’s story all about frogs. It’s surprisingly exhilarating stuff.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ilovem83.com/\">ilovem83.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>ANE BRUN</strong></p>\n<p>Ane Brun will bring the songs from the new album When I&#8217;m Free to Tøyenparken, along with other highlights from her career.
