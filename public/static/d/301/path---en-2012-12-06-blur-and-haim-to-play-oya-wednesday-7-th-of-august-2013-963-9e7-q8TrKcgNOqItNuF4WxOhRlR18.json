They sadly had to cancel in 2012, but in 2013 they will be ready with their debut album.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More bands will be confirmed soon.</p>\n<p><strong>BLUR (UK)</strong><br />\nBlur became world famous in the 90s thanks to records like &#8220;Parklife&#8221; and &#8220;The Great Escape&#8221; and hits such as &#8220;Girls &amp; Boys&#8221;, &#8220;Country House&#8221; , &#8220;Song 2&#8221;, “End of A Century”, “To The End” and “Beetlebum” songs that made them the pop band of the decade. They had a total of 13 top hits in the UK. Blur is surely one of the classic British bands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since the start in 1989 Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree have shown a amazing ability to renew themself.<br />\nEarlier this year, Blur wrote two news songs ahead of their massive sold out show in London&#8217;s Hyde Park marking the closing of the Olympic Games. The songs &#8216;The Puritan&#8217; and &#8216;Under The Westway&#8217; were debuted live on Twitter via a worldwide video stream from a London rooftop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And twenty one years since the release of their debut album, 2012 also saw “Blur 21: The Box”, the band&#8217;s body of work compiled and gathered together into one box; and “Parklive”, the DVD/2CD recorded in Hyde Park this summer. Some quotes from the Hyde Park show this summer</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Blur have the songs to match all moods.” – The Guardian</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Modern life may be rubbish, but for one night it was close to perfect.” – Daily Telegraph</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This was park life at its brilliant best.” – Evening Standard</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Blur evince the simple delight of a band who have already proved everything they needed to&#8230; They rose to the occasion … this was a moment like no other.” – Q Magazine</p>\n<p>After Blur headlined Glastonbury in 2009, The Guardian claimed that they were &#8220;the best Glastonbury headliners in an age&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Get ready for a Blur party when they enter our biggest stage in early August. The set list will be full of fan favorites. Considering the large audiences they have at home, this is almost like an intimate concert. We’re already smiling!<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.blur.co.uk/\">http://www.blur.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>HAIM (US)</strong></p>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\">Danielle, Este and Alana Haim were lucky enough to have parents that were into music. The sisters grew up playing in a family band with their mother and father, and were inspired by classic rock, folk and americana early on. Later, they discovered contemporary RnB, which also impacted their music in a significant way. Since then, they have become great songwriters and performers. Their free EP Forever has been available online for a while and gained great reviews. <a href=\"http://Prettymuchamazing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Prettymuchamazing.com</a> wrote that HAIM has &#8220;taken the cues of their multifaceted musical childhood and blended it into a sound that&#8217;s all their own&#8221;. </span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><br />\n</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\">Danielle Haim has the most impressive resume of the three after playing with both Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) and Jenny Lewis (Rilo Kiley), but they&#8217;re all excellent musicians capable of delivering a charismatic and exciting live performance. HAIM&#8217;s debut album is due next year, but the trio has already been listed on Norwegian national radio twice. The song Forever is cited by many as a highlight from 2012, we won&#8217;t be surprised if it appears on quite a few lists of the best songs this year. There are very good reasons to look forward to the record and their gig at Øya in August.
