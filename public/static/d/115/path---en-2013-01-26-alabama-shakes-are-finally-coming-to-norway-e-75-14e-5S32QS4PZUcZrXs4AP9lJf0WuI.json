The album Girls &amp; Boys and the single Hold On were among the highlights from 2012. This summer the band finally coming to Norway to play at the festival on Wednesday 7<sup>th</sup> of august. This is a concert you should not miss.</p>\n<p>ALABAMA SHAKES (US)<br />\nAlabama Shakes had a lot of success last year. Their debut album Girls &amp; Boys was well received by both music media and the public. The band&#8217;s mix of traditional American music with a southern flavor, has given them a significant amount of fans in a short time.</p>\n<p>This quartet was formed in Alabama a few years ago. In the beginning, they mixed a few of their own songs with covers of everything from Otis Redding to AC / DC. They released an EP in 2011. Quickly people discovered the song Hold On and the band&#8217;s stylish mix of soul, rock and blues.</p>\n<p>Their album was released in the spring of 2012 and ended in the top ten on the album charts in the US and several European countries. Robert Plant, Jack White, David Byrne, Arctic Monkeys, Booker T Jones, Bon Iver, Drive-By Truckers and Adele are some of the musicians who are fans of the band.<br />\nPopmatters.com wrote this about the album:<br />\n&#8211; Essentially, it is a near perfect blend of blues and rock ‘n’ roll of times both past and present. It’s an album you can listen to over and over again, and still somehow marvel at the familiar voice of Brittany Howard every time. Boys &amp; Girls is more than a debut album. It’s an introduction to a band you thought you knew for years, but are just fortunate enough to meet now.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.alabamashakes.com/\">http://www.alabamashakes.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","wordpress_id":2994,"featured_image":{"title":"Alabama Shakes, NME, January 2012","filename":"alabama-shakes-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","filesize":172509,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/alabama-shakes-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/alabama-shakes-nme-january-2012-4-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"BROOKLYN, NY - JANUARY 01: Band Alabama Shakes, with singer Brittany Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, bassist Zac Cockrell, and drummer Steve Johnson. photographed for NME on January 1, 2012 in Brooklyn, New York.
