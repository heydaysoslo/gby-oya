{"data":{"wordpressPage":{"title":"Purchase","content":"<p>To the extent possible, the Øyafestivalen will always choose products that are the most environmental friendly, during production, when it is in use and when it becomes waste. We focus on environmentally friendly, Eco-labeled, biodegradable and recyclable products. When we consider buying a product we think about durability, repair, services and alternative solutions for disposable products. We aim to prioritize local suppliers. To save the environment from transport costs, we prefer coordinated deliveries. Our partners and suppliers must follow laws and regulations in accordance with HSE regulations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The festival also has a return policy on goods and products that prove excessive to avoid an unnecessarily large inventory after the festival. In 2015, we entered into a partnership with <a href=\"http://Matsentralen.no\">Matsentralen</a>. To reduce food waste all our surplus food is donated via Matsentralen to peole in need in Oslo. So far we&#8217;ve donated over 2000 meals. </span></p>\n","wordpress_id":19122,"locale":"en","slug":"purchase","translations":{"nb":{"url":"/miljo/innkjop/"},"en":{"url":"/en/environment/purchase/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0929da1f-b808-523c-b492-011537935ca4","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
