{"data":{"wordpressPage":{"title":"Food","content":"<p>We are very picky when it comes to which bands we book to the festival &#8211; and the same goes for which restaurants we choose to serve food to our audience. At the festival you can eat Norway’s best &#8211; and most environmental friendly &#8211; festival food. In 2018 we served over 100 000 portions of organic food &#8211; and almost 40% of the portions sold were meat-free.</p>\n<p>We want to preserve our environment, and we believe that organic food production is natural part of a sustainable future. If you chose organic food, you avoid artificial additives, pesticides and industrial <span lang=\"en\">livestock</span>. At the same time you are saying yes to cleaner and more healthy food, more animal welfare, a greater biodiversity and less environmentally hostile emissions. In addition, the food tastes so much better.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2003 we have worked with the supervisory organ <a href=\"http://Debio.no\">Debio</a>. In 2013 we became the first festival in Norway who received the gold badge in organic food service &#8211; which means that over 90% of all the commodities we use are organic. In 2016 our brewery Ringnes produced Norway´s first organic beer for the festival &#8211; one year before they released it in stores. We also have an entires plastic-free </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food and drink serving: All food packaging is compostable (and is turned into biogas after the event) and all drinking beverages are reusable cups. This means since 2016, we have cut our use of plastic with 90%!</span></p>\n","wordpress_id":19124,"locale":"en","slug":"food","translations":{"nb":{"url":"/miljo/okologisk-mat/"},"en":{"url":"/en/environment/food/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ef071fda-fc90-502c-8434-8f50d9f97000","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
