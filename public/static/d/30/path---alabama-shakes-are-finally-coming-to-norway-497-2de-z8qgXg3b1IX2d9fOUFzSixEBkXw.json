It’s an album you can listen to over and over again, and still somehow marvel at the familiar voice of Brittany Howard every time. Boys &amp; Girls is more than a debut album. It’s an introduction to a band you thought you knew for years, but are just fortunate enough to meet now.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.alabamashakes.com/\">http://www.alabamashakes.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d602b99d-c616-5a25-9158-10e44d01c54e"}}
