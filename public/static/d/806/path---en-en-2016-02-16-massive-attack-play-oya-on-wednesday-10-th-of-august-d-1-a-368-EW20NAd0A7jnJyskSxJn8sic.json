{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Massive Attack play Øya on Wednesday 10th of August","date":"16th February 2016","content":"<p>Massive Attack took the entire music world by storm in the early 90s, with their debut album Blue Lines and the song Unfinished Sympathy. They became the definition of the term trip hop. Their style includes a mix of soul, dub and experimental pop. These days the band is led by two of the three founders, Robert “3D” Del Naja and Grant “Daddy G” Marshall, who keep the music of Massive Attack fresh and interesting. They just released the EP Ritual Spirit, which features Roots Manuva, Tricky and Young Fathers. The latter trio will also join Massive Attack on stage at Øya.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Drowned In Sound\" target=\"_blank\">Drowned In Sound</a> about the Ritual Spirit EP: &#8211; Maybe that’s me being nitpicky, though, as the only major flaw in Ritual Spirit is that it’s not an album. Massive Attack remain less a band, and more an institute of entropy, the light that pierces through the black hole, the frontrunners of a genre that they outran over a decade ago. Let the ramparts fall, then.</p>\n<p>They started in the late 80’s as a trio of producers. In 1998 their album Mezzanine went to number one in the British album charts. Each of their five studio albums have sold very well, and they have gold and platinum awards from several countries. In addition, they have done remixes for acts like Neneh Cherry, Nas, Peter Gabriel and Primal Scream.</p>\n<p>Allmusic.com have stated that Massive Atttack’s Blue Lines is &#8220;one of the best dance albums of all time&#8221;. About Mezzanine they wrote &#8211; With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.</p>\n<p>The new video to Ritual Spirit was created by the Norwegian duo Dusan Reljin and Hilde Pettersen Reljin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.massiveattack.co.uk/\">www.massiveattack.co.uk</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":15677,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2016/02/16/massive-attack-play-oya-on-wednesday-10th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"567b18a1-9563-5b92-9869-62bdbd13c0a7","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
