{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"b’Arte by Tor Erik Bøe","date":"8th August 2018","content":"<p>In a salon situated in the middle of the food court at the festival, visual artist Tor Erik Bøe is offering festival goers an extraordinary makeover. With the help of professional hair stylists and make-up artists, he will transform your face into a work of art. The salon is open for drop-ins, and free!</p>\n<p>The art project <em>b’Arte </em>takes its inspiration from the “see and be seen” culture that flourishes at music festivals, and also comments on the social media tendency to mediate experiences via filters on Instagram and Snapchat. Participants in the art project will, therefore, be photographed, and their portrait will be presented intermittently on the big screens across the festival.</p>\n<p>Tor Erik Bøe is the first artist in a series of collaborations between the Munch Museum and the Øya Festival to promote contemporary art. This year’s art project for the Øya Festival has been curated by Trine Otte Bak Nielsen and Natalie Hope O’Donnell from the Munch Museum.</p>\n","wordpress_id":22538,"translations":{"nb":{"url":"/2018/08/08/barte-av-tor-erik-boe/"},"en":{"url":"/en/2018/08/08/barte-by-tor-erik-boe/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"65c4c01d-8564-58cc-aaab-fcccf8a9296e","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
