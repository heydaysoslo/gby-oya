This is an excellent opportunity to hang on to that great festival feeling and bring it along to the city. Nighttime Øya is arranged in cooperation with the best organizers and clubs in Oslo. Due to varying conditions and the need for organizers to get these gigs/ club concepts to go round, it is not possible to include Nighttime Øya in the festival pass. A valid Øya ticket for the day of the event (or a full festival pass) offers discounts at Nighttime Øya.</p>\n","wordpress_id":2312,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/06/19/nighttime-oya-at-the-crossroad-club/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"571431d2-eae8-5a97-9ab8-fecb0b690c88","locale":"en"}}
