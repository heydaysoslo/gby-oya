We apologise to all our followers in Norway and Sweden who were excited to see us for the first time and we intend to reschedule performances in the very near future.“</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>SEI A (UK)</strong></p>\n<p>The Scottish DJ and musician Sei A belongs to a new generation of British producers that ensure that the potent British bass culture merges with good old fashioned house music. Sei A has already released two albums (the last of them on Tigas Turbo label), as well as remixes for the M83, Booka Shade and Azari &amp; III. He has also created a sensation by delivering bold edits of the Rolling Stones and Billie Holiday. Sei A’s DJ sets are synonymous with deep, melodic and very danceable music.</p>\n","wordpress_id":2741,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/08/09/sei-a-to-play-klubben/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"5d15225c-a74f-54e8-9c5b-acaf1db02c8f","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
