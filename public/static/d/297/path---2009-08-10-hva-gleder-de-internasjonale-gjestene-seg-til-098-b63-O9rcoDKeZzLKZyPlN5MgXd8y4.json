Her er noen resultater, som viser at flere av de britiske gjestene gleder seg voldsomt til å oppdage ny norsk musikk i løpet av Øyafestivalen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/oya-festival-top-picks\" target=\"_blank\">Les Clash Magazine her</a></p>\n<p>h4. Tim Chester &#8211; NME.com</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ungdomskulen\" target=\"_blank\">Ungdomskulen</a><br />\nI’ve loved the ludicrous histrionics and technical virtuosity of this lot for a while now. The fact that no-one’s ben able to hear their second LP is a travesty so hopefully there’ll be some record industry types next to me at their gig this week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/toddterje\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Terje</a><br />\nHaving never been to Oya I’ve no idea what the nightlife is like, but if it’s anything like the cosmic disco clubs in the UK that play long Todd Terje excursions we’re all in for a treat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/Bagpiperatthegatesofdawn\" target=\"_blank\">Centre Of The Universe</a><br />\nThe first track I listenined to sounded like Circulus covering King Crimson’s Starless at a renaissance fayre: gypsy prog extraordinaire. It’s kind of Beiruty too, especially the excellently titled Hercolobus Is Approaching</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/altaarnorway\" target=\"_blank\">Altaar</a><br />\nIt seems wrong to travel to the land of black metal and not experience some eardrum battery, and the ambient doom of Altaar resonated with me from my first exposure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/bygdin\" target=\"_blank\">Bygdin</a><br />\nSpace-kraut at its finest.</p>\n<p>h4. Mark Johnson &#8211; Koko, booker</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/krakesolv\" target=\"_blank\">Kråkesølv</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/fireflyeffect\" target=\"_blank\">Firelfy Effect</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/cheatersoslo\" target=\"_blank\">The Cheaters</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ungdomskulen\" target=\"_blank\">Ungdomskulen</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/megaphonicthrift\" target=\"_blank\">The Megaphonic Thrift</a></p>\n<p>h4. Dylan Huges &#8211; Vice Magazine UK</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/altaarnorway\" target=\"_blank\">Altaar</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/kvelertak\" target=\"_blank\">Kvelertak</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/farmersmarkettheband\" target=\"_blank\">Farmers Market</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ungdomskulen\" target=\"_blank\">Ungdomskulen</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/auranoir\" target=\"_blank\">Aura Noir</a></p>\n<p>h4.<br />\nAndy Inglis &#8211; The Luminiare, booker</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ungdomskulen\" target=\"_blank\">Ungdomskulen</a><br />\nStill the best band Norway has ever produced (sorry A-Ha), theirs is a near-uncategorisable collision of tech-prog-rock-disco, performed with awesome musicianship and a willful disregard for traditional song-structures. It&#8217;s about time the UK industry woke up to them instead of shaking their heads at their &#8220;funny&#8221; name then going back to watching the sun shine out of Fleet Foxes&#8217; collective arsehole. And who doesn&#8217;t love a four-minute clockwork cowbell breakdown? You don&#8217;t? Well fuck off then.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/manhattanbitches\" target=\"_blank\">Manhattan Skyline </a><br />\nRunning Ungdomskullen a close second for the best-band-Norway-has-ever-produced award, they managed to deliver the finest live performance I&#8217;ve seen in five years at last year&#8217;s Øya, and gave me welcome respite from the cloying, crushing dullness of Fleet Foxes pretty five-part harmonies on the other stage. Expect incendiary mathcore/tech-metal. And no pretty five-part harmonies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/normasass\" target=\"_blank\">Norma Sass</a><br />\nA pop band! A good one too. They have linguistic dexterity and lyrical finesse thanks to Thea Glenton Raknes and her agile, mellifluous voice and they play their instruments pretty well too. One of the most enjoyable acts at by:Larm earlier this year and the fact they&#8217;re easy-on-the-eye girls in summery dresses doesn&#8217;t hurt. But don&#8217;t let that distract you from all that shiny indie-pop, particularly &#8216;Born In The ’80s&#8217;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/nortmiehd\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Credible</a><br />\nIt&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t have a few one-man synth &#8216;n&#8217; toy-instruments set ups around but few are as engaging or as funny as Oslo&#8217;s Captain Credible. Imagine Squarepusher performed on a Spectrum 48k by someone called Daniel Eugene Lacey-McDermott. Good eh?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/nilsbech\" target=\"_blank\">Nils Bech</a><br />\nNils Bech&#8217;s voice is accented and camp-operatic and it knits together a warm but regimented palette of electro-pop. It&#8217;s as likely to piss me off as it is to make me tap my feet, and it&#8217;s a nailed-on, cast-iron guarantee that he&#8217;s got a shaved chest, but whatever. He plays with a saxophonist on stage, is a mainstay of Oslo&#8217;s contemporary performance art scene, probably thinks of his songs as &#8216;compositions&#8217;, and sounds a wee bit like Patrick Wolf if Patrick Wolf was a big Pet Shop Boys fan, and, for that last reason alone, I&#8217;m in.</p>\n<p>h4. Steve Tilley &#8211; Kilimanjaro Live</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/iwasaking\" target=\"_blank\">I Was A King</a><br />\n – Saw them at Great Escape and really enjoyed and would love to see them on home turf so to speak</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/katzenjammerne\" target=\"_blank\">Katzenhammer</a><br />\n– I missed them at Slotsfjell recently but heard lots of people talking about them after their set so i’m going to make amends at Oya and get to check them out</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/satyricon\" target=\"_blank\">Satyricon</a><br />\n– You can’t beat a dose of Norwegian thrash metal and the drummer alone makes it worth the admission price</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/karinpark\" target=\"_blank\">Karin Park</a><br />\n– Has been recommended to me by a friend so i’m intrigued by his description.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/diskjokke\" target=\"_blank\">Diskjokke</a><br />\n – Again i have heard great things and Coda Agency have picked him up in the UK so i’d also liked to check out</p>\n<p>h4. Matt Bennett &#8211; Clash Magazine</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mungolianjetset\" target=\"_blank\">Mungolian Jet Set</a><br />\nThe Norwegians do disco better than most and this cosmic duo are no exception. Deep, dark and percussive their sonic trajectories are set steeply to the stars. The magical pairing of Pål Nyhus and Knut Petter Sævik will keep you dancing &#8217;til you shimmy straight passed the Northern lights into the Mungolian’s own twinkling galaxies of sound.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/nortmiehd\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Credible</a><br />\nIt’s all too easy for electronic music to lack character. Not so with Captain Credible. Our captain has AS much personality as he does bleeps and bass. And he’s surfing a bigger lysergic wave than most. We’ve heard loads about this chap and Clash is looking forward to discovering the flavour of his mosh pit. A sonic stramash that sounds like Legowelt having a wank in the Warp offices. Whilst Trent Reznor watches and beats off too. Messy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ungdomskulen\" target=\"_blank\">Ungdomskulen</a><br />\nPerhaps the most hyped and eagerly awaited of the Norwegians this year, it seems the festival can’t come around fast enough for their fans. Or Ungdomskulen themselves. Their blocky, 8-Bit rock destroyed our London Clash club in May as their relentless, kinetic and most importantly fun rock is precise yet injected with enough buoyancy to carry any crowd. They may rule the whole festival.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/harrysgym\" target=\"_blank\">Harry’s Gym</a></p>\n<p>We had the pleasure of catching these icy rockers in February at the By:Larm conference as they fast impressed with their gnats ass rhythms squeezed ever tighter, glacial delivery and pounding songs borne for the stadiums. We have no idea why they are called Harry’s Gym but relish the chance to find out this weekend over Øya.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/diskjokke\" target=\"_blank\">DiskJokke</a><br />\nAnother Smalltown Supersound artist but too good not to tip the Clash hat at, Joachim Dyrdahl has been making his spaced out dance music since he was 15. You can fucking tell. Now a jewel in the crowns of labels such as Feedelity, Rebirth and Bear Funk, he’s a dexterous man of dance who brings a rare subtlety to his productions. Whereas Lindstrom often gets the plaudits, Joachim may increasingly be winning the deeper hearts.</p>\n<p>h4.
