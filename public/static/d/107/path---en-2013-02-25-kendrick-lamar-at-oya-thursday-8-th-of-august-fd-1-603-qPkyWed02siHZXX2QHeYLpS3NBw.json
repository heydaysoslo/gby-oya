His internal dialogues splatter across multiple musical movements as peer pressure suffocates and gangs wage war and lovers quarrel and alcohol intoxicates and friends die and mothers nag.</p>\n<p>On Thursday the 8<sup>th</sup> of august he will play on our main stage in the park. He will prove why he is one of the most talked about young solo artist from the United States right now, regardless of style or genre.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.kendricklamar.com/splash\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.kendricklamar.com/splash</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","wordpress_id":3111,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2013/02/25/kendrick-lamar-at-oya-thursday-8th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"aca9a89f-e6cc-5a59-b34b-92f4a7e7de4d","locale":"en"}}
