In the  spring they released the 2011 album My Head Is An Animal in the rest of Europe. The album entered the top ten in countries such as UK, USA, Canada, Germany, Netherlands and of course Iceland. They now tend to sell out in every country they choose to tour. If you like Arcade Fire, The Magic Numbers, Mumford &amp; Sons and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros, Of Monsters and Men can soon become your new favorites.<br />\nBBC was impressed with the debut and wrote: &#8211; There isn’t a bad pop song here, and the balance between whimsy, sensitivity and boisterous fun is expertly weighted. Little Talks is dominating the airwaves, but Of Monsters and Men are far more than one-hit wonders.</p>\n<p>Of Monsters And Men have come very far in the two years since they got together. Their mix of folk rock and guitar pop, will probably get them an even bigger audience in the next 12 months. They are, in our opinion, the perfect festival band.<br />\n<a title=\"www.ofmonstersandmen.is\" href=\"http://www.ofmonstersandmen.is/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ofmonstersandmen.is/</a><br />\n<strong>TØNES</strong><br />\nAfter 16 years as a recording artist Frank Tønnesen, known as Tønes, finally got his breakthrough. With this year&#8217;s album, Sån Av Salve, he impressed both record buyers and critics. The media predicted that this would bring Tønes’ music to a wider audience. Looking at the ticket sales during the fall tour, one can establish that they were right. Sån Av Salve has spent two weeks among the ten best-selling albums in Norway.</p>\n<p>The folk singer from Sokndal in Rogaland made his debut with Rett Te Håves in 1996. Since then he has released several great album and EPs. Tønes writes songs with a certain melancholy, but he can also make you laugh out loud. He sings lyrics are full of everyday problems and songs with a gleam of hope. Frank Tønnesen played first time at Øya in 2009, at our smallest stage. This summer he returns as a crowd favorite.<br />\n<a title=\"www.toenes.com\" href=\"http://www.toenes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.toenes.com/</a><br />\n<strong>REBEKKA KARIJORD</strong><br />\nRebecca Karijord recently released her fourth album We Become Ourselves.
