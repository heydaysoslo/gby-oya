They have been playing everything from basements and shops to clubs and festivals. METZ has shared stages with bands such as Mission of Burma, Death from Above 1979, Archers of Loaf, Mudhoney, Oneida, Constantines and Nomeansno. The music is a mix of hardcore, noise, indie and metal, with hints of legendary groups like The Pixies, The Jesus Lizard, Public Image Ltd., Big Black and Dinosaur Jr.</p>\n<p>In October, the group released their self-titled debut album on SubPop, an album that was very well received by the international music press and the public. Live the trio is all about energy. Loud and tight arrangements creates a special atmosphere:</p>\n<p>&#8211; I was loved METZ som much when I was in New York last year, that I ended up seeing them four times in a week, says Øya’s booking manager Claes Olsen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.metzztem.com/\">http://www.metzztem.com/</a></p>\n","date":"2013-01-10T12:47:34.000Z","wordpress_id":2911,"featured_image":{"title":"METZ 1 (2012)","filename":"metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","filesize":180417,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/metz-1-2012-4-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"METZ Band Photo","caption":"","name":"metz-1-2012-4-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2013-01-10 09:46:43","modified":"2013-01-10 09:46:43","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2013/01/metz-yafestivalen-2013-635x3501.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2013/01/10/metz-confirmed-for-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7eac3597-3d33-5c1f-acff-1e7f34a06dad","locale":"en"}}
