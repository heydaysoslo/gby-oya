{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Disclosure at Øya","date":"29th January 2013","content":"<p>One of the freshest new names in British club music is coming to Øya this August. Disclosure is a young duo on the rise and their debut album is out in March.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLOSURE (UK)</strong></p>\n<p>Disclosure are among the UK’s most in-demand producers of the moment. In 2012 they got a big hit with the single Latch and had success with their remix of Jessie Ware’s Running. Disclosure has impressed many with their garage-/house-sound. In a few weeks their debut album will be released. So far Disclosure has made use of vocal help from Sam Smith, Sinead Harnett and Alunageorge.</p>\n<p>Stereogum wrote this about the new single White Noise:<br />\n&#8211; Disclosure are a British duo twisting late-’90s UK garage into fun new shapes. AlunaGeorge are a British duo doing similar things with late-’90s R&amp;B. And given how close late-’90s UK garage and R&amp;B always were anyway, maybe it was inevitable that the two groups would come together on one song. That song is “White Noise,” Disclosure’s new single, and it’s a fleet, slick dance banger that, on first listen, is sounding like one of the year’s most undeniable new songs thus far. Seriously, this is a good one.<br />\nDisclosure are Guy and Howard Lawrence, two young brothers from Surrey, just south of London. They started making music under the name Disclosure 2010 and have since toured with SBTRKT and Hot Chip. Check them out at Øya on Friday 9<sup>th</sup> of August.<br />\n<a href=\"http://disclosureofficial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://disclosureofficial.com/</a></p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"66d70b2f-0e9d-5fa3-a73c-87cc032823ec"}}
