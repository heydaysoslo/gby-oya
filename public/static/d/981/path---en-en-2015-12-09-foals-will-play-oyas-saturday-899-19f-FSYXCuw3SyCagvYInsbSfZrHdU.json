They are an extraordinary live band, something they will prove on several continents in 2016. On Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> of August they will play Øya.</p>\n<p>Foals from Oxford have released four albums in their ten year history. They are considered to be one of Britain&#8217;s best live bands and won an award for this in Q Magazine in 2013. The same magazine gave them the award for being the best band in the world in 2015. All their albums have been in the top ten in the UK charts, and their success in Europe is ever increasing. In their songs, you can hear traces of catchy pop, post-rock, danceable rhythms and energetic indie, combined with members&#8217; background in so-called math rock.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foals.co.uk/\">www.foals.co.uk</a></p>\n<p>photo Niel Krug</p>\n","wordpress_id":15673,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2015/12/09/foals-will-play-oyas-saturday/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f2ab7807-10e3-5d59-9069-4cff2514b231","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
