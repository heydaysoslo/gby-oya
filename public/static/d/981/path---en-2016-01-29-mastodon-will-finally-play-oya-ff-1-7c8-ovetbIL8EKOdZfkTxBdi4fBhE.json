The band will play to their loyal Norwegian fans on Thursday 11th of August.</p>\n","content":"<p>Mastodon (US)</p>\n<p>The quartet from Atlanta, Georgia released the fantastic album Once More &#8216;Round The Sun in 2014. The album is a bit more straightforward than we are are used to from the band, but still they are in a class of their own both as songwriters and musicians.

Mastodon’s first album was Remission from 2002. Their following grew with the concept albums Leviathan (2004), Blood Mountain (2006), Crack The Skye (2009) and The Hunter (2011). Mastodon are now one of the most important and influential bands in hard and heavy rock.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mastodonrocks.com/\">www.mastodonrocks.com</a></p>\n","date":"2016-01-29T08:54:17.000Z","wordpress_id":5806,"featured_image":{"title":"mastodon oyafestivalen 2016 crop","filename":"mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","filesize":99996,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop-2-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop-2-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2016-01-28 11:40:21","modified":"2016-01-28 11:40:21","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1-300x188.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":188,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1-768x480.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":480,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","large_width":800,"large_height":500,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":200,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":400,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2016/01/mastodon-oyafestivalen-2016-crop1.jpg","xlarge_width":800,"xlarge_height":500}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2016/01/29/mastodon-will-finally-play-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c182e23c-1b99-5b8d-9806-4fb5ff822d9c","locale":"en"}}
