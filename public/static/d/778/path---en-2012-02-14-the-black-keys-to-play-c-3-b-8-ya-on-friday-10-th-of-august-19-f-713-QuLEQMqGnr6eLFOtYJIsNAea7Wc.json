The Black Keys are one of the bands our audience really wanted us to book for this year’s festival. To get the duo to Norway has been hard, since the band has become insanely big in the U.S. and the UK. The Black Keys are now confirmed to play on our main stage on Friday 10<sup>th</sup> of August.</p>\n<p>They are headlining one of the world&#8217;s biggest festivals, Coachella in California. They have sold out three concerts at the giant Alexandria Palace in London, several months in advance. Their latest album, El Camino, has given them a large audience in Norway. We believe the Norwegian fan base will grow even larger in the coming months.</p>\n<p>On the same day you can see such acts as Refused, The Devil&#8217;s Blood and Nicolas Jaar and many more. Check the web site for updates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Day tickets for the four days in the park are still available. Call the ticket office at</p>\n<p>(0047) 815 33 133</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>THE BLACK KEYS (US)</strong><br />\nEl Camino by The Black Keys has been one of the most popular albums in the festival office for the last few months. The album was released just before christmas and was well received. It was their second in a row that went into the top three on the album charts in the US. The album is full of classic, catchy rock. It is also has clear traces of soul, garage rock and blues. The band has in recent years taken the step up from sweaty bars to large arenas, both at home and in Europe. On Friday 10<sup>th</sup> of August you can, for the first time, experience the band in large format in Norway.</p>\n<p>The Guardian wrote, &#8220;They sound like a band who think they&#8217;ve made the year&#8217;s best rock and roll album, Probably because that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;ve done&#8221;</p>\n<p>For over ten years, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney explored dirty blues and groovy rock. It started with a few homemade recordings from Carney’s basement in Ohio. After several years on the road between small clubs throughout the U.S., they built a larger audience by the release of Attack &amp; Release (2008) and Brothers (2010). The first of these and the single Tighten Up from the other, was produced by Brian &#8220;Danger Mouse&#8221; Burton. He is known from Gnarls Barkley, Broken Bells, being a producer and a lot of other musical projects. Danger Mouse was still at the controls of the recording of El Camino, and the result is very successful to say the least.</p>\n<p>Auerbach, Carney and their two live musicians are going to make spectacular party at The Øya Festival on Friday 10<sup>th</sup> of august. Anyone with a sense of real quality rock riffs have got to be there.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.theblackkeys.com/\">http://www.theblackkeys.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>photo: Danny Clinch</p>\n","wordpress_id":1795,"featured_image":{"title":"the black keys clinch 635x350","filename":"the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","filesize":77391,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/the-black-keys-clinch-635x350-2-2/","alt":"","author":"4","description":"","caption":"","name":"the-black-keys-clinch-635x350-2-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2012-02-13 19:48:50","modified":"2012-02-13 19:48:50","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":635,"height":350,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501-300x165.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":165,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","medium_large_width":635,"medium_large_height":350,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","large_width":635,"large_height":350,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":176,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","medium_small_width":635,"medium_small_height":350,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2012/02/the-black-keys-clinch-635x3501.jpg","xlarge_width":635,"xlarge_height":350}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2012/02/14/the-black-keys-to-play-%c3%b8ya-on-friday-10th-of-august/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b7323215-860e-5c64-88c8-9b85585ee133","locale":"en"}}
