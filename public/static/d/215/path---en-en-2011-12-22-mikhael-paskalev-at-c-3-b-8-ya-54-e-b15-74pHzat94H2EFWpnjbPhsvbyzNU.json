We are excited, and so is the artist himself. We predict that his fangroup will grow considerably during the next nine months.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MIKHAEL PASKALEV</p>\n<p>Every year, the Øya Festival picks out a few artists who made an impression at the Club Day the previous year. This time, Mikhael Paskalev will be playing his first gig in the park, in front of a large Øya-audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paskalev writes great songs in the musical landscape between americana and indie pop. He says his inspiration comes from the likes of Paul Simon, The Shins and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. His songs are wonderfully catchy and they have the ability to become favourites rather quickly. Try I Spy for instance. He has started working on his debut album which he plans to release after The Øya Festival. Expect lovely festival tunes, suitable for the Oslo park life.</p>\n","wordpress_id":15650,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2011/12/22/mikhael-paskalev-at-%c3%b8ya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"61593c8a-8dfc-5604-9efc-91f56d18edc9","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
