He is part of the so-called Oslo-disco scene, together with names like Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas. He’s been a popular and influential DJ and live artist for years, but mainstream attention came with the EP It&#8217;s The Arps and it’s lead single Inspector Norse in 2012. In April he will release his proper debut album, and we expect it to be one of the best releases from Norway this year. The album is appropriately titled It&#8217;s Album Time and will mark the ten year anniversary of Terje Olsen using the name Todd Terje, which he first used for the 12” Eurodance in 2004. Living legend Bryan Ferry provides guest vocals on Terje’s interpretation of Robert Palmer&#8217;s song Johnny and Mary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork about the EP It&#8217;s The Arps</a>: &#8211; …the clean lines and easy momentum of It&#8217;s the Arps are really refreshing. And Jesus, it&#8217;s fun.</p>\n<p>He has previously remixed the likes of Chic, Hot Chip, Franz Ferdinand and the aforementioned Bryan Ferry. Todd Terje has played everything from small, crowded clubs to being a big attraction at festivals abroad. Last year he headlined the stage Øya presented during the festival Nuits Sonores in Lyon, and was a huge success. At the moment he is planning the album release and a fantastic show for the main stage in Tøyenparken on Saturday 9th of August . Todd Terje hasnt&#8217;t revealed details yet, but he has promised us a spectacular finale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://toddterje.com/\">http://toddterje.com/</a></p>\n<p>foto Christian Belgaux</p>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gHiqPG0526U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div data-size=\"500x750\" class=\"WPEditor__embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F92182988&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=500&#038;maxheight=750\"></iframe></div>\n","date":"2014-02-19T12:28:53.000Z","wordpress_id":4228,"featured_image":{"title":"todd terje press photo by christian belgaux oyafestivalen 2014 crop","filename":"todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","filesize":206043,"url":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","link":"http://oya.test/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop-2/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2014-02-18 14:13:42","modified":"2014-02-18 14:13:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://oya.test/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":900,"height":450,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"medium":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop-300x150.jpg","medium_width":300,"medium_height":150,"medium_large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop-768x384.jpg","medium_large_width":768,"medium_large_height":384,"large":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","large_width":900,"large_height":450,"small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","small_width":320,"small_height":160,"medium_small":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","medium_small_width":640,"medium_small_height":320,"xlarge":"http://oya.test/assets/uploads/2014/02/todd-terje-press-photo-by-christian-belgaux-oyafestivalen-2014-crop.jpg","xlarge_width":900,"xlarge_height":450}},"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2014/02/19/todd-terje-to-headline-the-saturday/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"43a26623-04e2-5c3f-bf19-a80c4a6bb369","locale":"en"}}
