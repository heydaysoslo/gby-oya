In august they will play in The Medieval Park during Øya.</p>\n<p><strong>KVELERTAK</strong><br />\nKvelertak is a success story like no other in Norwegian rock in the past few years. Fans all over the world are now waiting for their second album, Meir. We’ve heard the new songs, and you are in for a treat. The album will offer new doses of metal, hard rock and roll and punk. Like last time they have been in the studio with Kurt Ballou of Converge.</p>\n<p>Their debut album from 2010 spent impressive 30 weeks on the Norwegian album chart, a feat considering how uncompromising the music is. Kvelertak has been on countless tours with some of the greatest underground bands, like Coliseum, Converge, Toxic Holocaust, Torche and Kylesa. Few Norwegian bands are playing as much abroad as Kvelertak. The result is that international music media and fans on both sides of the Atlantic got their eye on what the band is doing. Put Kvelertak on stage and you are guaranteed delightful rock rampage joy and primal screams from both band and fans.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Kvelertak\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/Kvelertak</a></p>\n","wordpress_id":15664,"translations":{"nb":null,"en":{"url":"/en/2013/01/23/kvelertak-are-coming-to-oya/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f9d57806-4dd4-5817-b853-d9d54d47e278","locale":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","nb"],"messages":{"404.button":"Go back to the front page","404.title":"Hmm, we could not find that page (404)","artists.hideButton":"See less","artists.showButton":"See more","badges.new":"New","blog.allYears":"All years","blog.allpostsloaded":"All posts loaded","blog.noresult":"Could not find any posts for the current query","button.loadMore":"Load more","button.loading":"Loading","categories.all":"All","errorboundary.button":"Report error","errorboundary.desc":"Please help us with reporting the error, so that we can attend to it.
